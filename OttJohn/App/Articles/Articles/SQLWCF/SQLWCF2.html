Okay, the first thing we are going to do is create the service. In this case, open Visual Studio, go to File, New Project, and 
then select WCF Service Application. Name your application something other than Service1 (I named mine SQLWCF, for example), and 
then proceed to make the approprate changes to the service and interface names as well.
<p />
    <img src="App/Articles/Articles/SQLWCF/WCFApp.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
<ol>
    <li>In the Solution Explorer, right click on the service name and change it to reflect the name you've given to the project</li>
    <li>In the Solution Explorer, right click on the interface name and change it to reflect the name you've given to the service</li>
    <li>Open the code behind the service file and ensure that it's interface has the appropriate name; That is, make certain that it is 
    the same as the class name, only prepended with an I</li>
    <li>Remove from the interface and the code behind the service everything except the method GetData</li>
    <li>Right click on the service name and view the markup. Ensure that reference under the Service attribute points to your service name and not Service1</li>
</ol>
<p />
Once you've straightened out the service, go ahead and modify the GetData method so it looks like this:
<p />
<pre>
    public string GetData(string FirstName, string LastName)
    {
        string FullName = FirstName + " " + LastName;
        return FullName;
    }
</pre>
<p />
After you've done this, make sure you change the signature of the method in the interface as well. At this point, we are going to go to IIS 
and add this project as an application. Note: if you do not have IIS installed on your computer, you should install it. You can do this by 
going to your control panel and clicking on Programs and Features. When you see the dialog, click on <i>Turn Windows features on or off</i> (this 
article assumes that you are not using Windows 8). Once you've done that, select Internet Information Services. There may be some features under 
this suite that you do not want on your computer (such as FTP), so be careful about what you choose. If you have any difficulty, please do a search on 
installing IIS before proceeding. My assumption here is that you are familiar enough with web development that you can get around in IIS. Here is 
a image for reference:
<p />

<p />
Go to the Control Panel, then Administrative Tools. Once there, open up Internet Information Services (IIS). Expand the machine node in the 
Connections panel on the left, expand the Sites node, and then expand the Default Web Site node. 
<p />
    <img src="App/Articles/Articles/SQLWCF/IIS.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Now do the following:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Right click on the Default Web Site node and select Add Application</li>
    <li>In the Dialog, enter a name for the application under the Alias field. This is the same as the name you would create for a virtual directory</li>
    <li>Under the Physical Path field, point to the directory that contains your service</li>
</ol>
<p />
Once you've created your application, Click on it's name in the left-hand pane; then click on the Content View tab at the vary bottom of the main pain. 
This will show you all of the files associted with your application. Find the service file and right click on it. Select Browse. This should bring up 
a description of your service in your browser. The page will give you a couple of WSDL links but nothing else very useful. Up in the location field 
in the browser, however, you will have the path to your service. Copy this and put it somewhere where you can find it later.

Next up, we will construct the SQL Server code so we can purposely crash this whole process.
