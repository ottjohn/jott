We now have a service and we now have a stored procedure that looks as though it can make a call to the service. Let's see if it works. 
Go ahead and run the following in a SQL Server Query window:
<p />
<pre>
    declare @ReturnValue varChar(1000)
    exec TestWebService 'YourFirstName', 'YourLastName', @ReturnValue output
    print @ReturnValue
</pre>
<p />
Once you've run this, you will find that you are going to get nothing meaningful in return. The reason is really simple: SQL Server cannot use 
MSXML to talk to a WCF service. So all of our time up to this point is wasted. Just kidding. We need to basically turn our WCF service into a RESTful 
service, one that we can communicate with over the URL in a browser. Right now, it is not set up to do that. You can test this by entering the following 
into the location field of your broswer:
<p />
<pre>
    http://localhost/SQLWCF/SQLWCF.svc/GetData?FirstName=YourFirstName&LastName=YourLastName
</pre>
<p />
You will either get an error, a 404, or nothing at all. There are only a few things we need to do to make this work, and here they are: first, we 
need to describe the action for the service by decorating the method with a UriTemplate. Do this in the following way:
<p />
<pre>
    [WebGet(UriTemplate = "/GetData?FirstName={FirstName}&LastName={LastName}", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Xml)]
</pre>
<p />
Note that WebGet is under the System.SeviceModel.Web namespace, so if you do not have that reference, add it. The next thing we need to do is modify our 
web config file to create an endpoint that the service will listen to. It will work under webHttpBinding and not basicHttpBinding. For the endpoint, do the 
following:
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;system.servicemodel&gt;
        &lt;services&gt;
            &lt;service name="WebHttpSQLServerWCF.SQLWCF"&gt;
                &lt;endpoint contract="WebHttpSQLServerWCF.ISQLWCF" binding="webHttpBinding" behaviorconfiguration="webHttp" /&gt;
            &lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;/services&gt;
        ...
</pre>
<p />
Here, under the service tag, the name attribute is going to have the namespace followed by the class name of your service. The endpoint is going to have the 
namespace followed by the interface name. Notice the binding type. There is also a behaviorConfiguration attribute that is defined below in the following way:
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;/services&gt;
    &lt;behaviors&gt;
        &lt;endpointbehaviors&gt;
            &lt;behavior name="webHttp"&gt;
                &lt;webhttp /&gt;
            &lt;/behavior&gt;
        &lt;/endpointbehaviors&gt;
        ...
</pre>
<p />
Once you've done this, compile your service project and hit that URL again from your browser. This time you should get the first and last name back. Once you 
are satisfied with that, execute your stored procedure. You should get the same thing back, but the result should be wrapped in a SOAP document. 
<p />
Sometimes, you will find a decent application of a technology where you least expect to. In this case, I was really dreading having to make both an adapter 
for a third-party payment system and a harness for that adapter within a VBA application. To say that would have sucked royally is putting it very mildly. 
After some thought, however, I figured that as long as the VBA app was using stored procedures to enter customer information in our system, why not use that 
same sproc to call a service that will invoke methods in the adapter that will query that entry and simply take over the processing from there? The anwswer? 
There is no reason why not to!
