We are going to do a little bit more than just page here: we are also going to sort and control the 
direction of the sort. We will, then, need to keep track of four variables:
<p />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>CurrentPage</b>: you will have to keep track of this on your client. It can be a variable in 
        your controller (if you use MVC), or it can simple be cached in JavaScript on your ASP.NET page.
        <p />
        When you manage this value, make sure that you check for boundaries. When I implement this sort 
        of thing, I typically have four buttons: <i>First</i>, <i>Prev</i>, <i>Next</i>, <i>Last</i>. The 
        math here is simple, so I am not going to bore you with it.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>PageCount</b>: the variable is going to depend on a record count. You will need to manage this 
        as well. If you are not filtering your data, then you can simply get the record count once, construct 
        your page count, and then cache your page count with your current page variable.
        <p />
        To get the page count, you need to figure out what you page size is going to be. You can make this configurable 
        if you like, or you can store it somewhere, like a config file, and use it as a constant. Again, this 
        is simple math (although a little more difficult than the previous calculations), so I will provide 
        a formula for this:
        <p />
        PageCount = Math.Ceiling((double)RecordCount/PageSize);
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>SortField</b>: you will have to cache this variable along with the others. I am not going to cover 
        how this will be implemented (although it will be illustrated in the example), but I will tell you that 
        you should make your column heading clickable. The first click sorts in ascending order. The second click 
        will sort on the same field but in descending order. Click it again, and you are back to ascending order. 
        Got it?
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>SortDirection</i>: cached and completely dependent on the sort field column and the number of consecutive 
        clicks it's received. The values for this should be <i>asc</i> and <i>desc</i>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p />
Now that we've covered a strategy for keeping track of the important, related variables on the client, let's look at the 
tsql.
