Here, we are defining a sql string to execute against. You may or may not be familiar with what's going on here. Let's 
look at the internal select first: Notice that it is aliased as a table? That's because it is going to be treated as one 
as the built-in ROW_NUMBER() function is going to count over the result set specified by the sort field and add those 
values to the aliased table. This way, you get a sequencial count and you do not have to worry about gaps in integer-valued 
identity columns or tables that have no numeric leaning at all.
<p />
Simply put, we are using the ROW_NUMBER() function over the <i>order by</i> clause, which is then aliased as <i>rowNum</i>. 
This is executed first and the result set is refered then by a table alias <i>tempTable</i>.
<p />
Once this result set is populated the outer select goes to work, and the paging is accomplished there (as you can see, 
the where clause belongs to the outer select). Now, when putting this string together, don't forget to convert your 
numerics into strings by using the <i>convert</i> function; otherwise, it won't work. Once this is accomplished, we place 
the data into the table variable and select from it:
<p />
<pre>
    insert into @tempTable exec(@ExecString)
	
	select
		rowNum, id, UserName, FirstName, LastName, email
	from
		@tempTable
</pre>
<p />
See? That wasn't so hard now, was it? Go to the next page to see an example of paging in action. Note that the grid and 
the pager are both mine (home-grown).
