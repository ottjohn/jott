Note: if you do not know how to call a stored procedure from your data layer, then this probably is not 
for you. Further, if you struggle with SQL, then this is probably not for you, either. Now that my late-
arriving disclaimers are out of the way, let's have a look at the stored procedure that manages the paging:
<p />
<pre>
    create procedure [dbo].[GetSampleData] (

	    @CurrentPage int,
	    @PageSize int,
	    @SortField varChar(50),
	    @SortDirection varChar(4)

    )
    as
    set nocount on

    begin

	    declare @tempTable table 
	    (
		    rowNum int,
		    id int, 
		    UserName varChar(50),
		    FirstName varchar(50), 
		    LastName varchar(50),  
		    email varchar(100)
	    )

	    declare @ExecString varChar(600)
	    if @SortField = '' set @SortField = 'LastName'
	    if @SortDirection = '' set @SortDirection = 'DESC'
	
	    set @ExecString = '	select
	            rowNum, id, UserName, FirstName, LastName, email
            from
	            (	select 
			            id, UserName, FirstName, LastName, email,
			            ROW_NUMBER() over (order by ' + @SortField +  ' ' + @SortDirection + ') as rowNum
		            from
			            SampleUserData ) as tempTable
            where
		            rowNum between ' + convert(varchar, (@CurrentPage - 1)*(@PageSize + 1)) +
		            ' AND ' +
		            convert(varchar, @CurrentPage*@PageSize)	
	
	    insert into @tempTable exec(@ExecString)
	
	    select
		    rowNum, id, UserName, FirstName, LastName, email
	    from
		    @tempTable
			
    end
</pre>
<p />
As you can see, there are only a few things to talk about here. At the top of the procedure, you can see the variables we 
outlined on the previous line are passed in. Then we create a table variable to hole our final result set, and we check the 
values of @SortField and @SortDirection and give them default values if they are empty.
<p />
Why do we have a table variable? Well, we could simply use the <i>exec</i> command on the sql string, and we would get the 
result if we were running this procedure in SSMS. This is, however, not where we are running this stored procedure. We are 
calling it from our DAL, and, because of that, it more than likely will have no idea what fields are coming its way because 
they would not have otherwise been explicitely defined. Please note that a temp table will not work here, either. 
<p />
Let's move on now to the meat of the matter.
