This one should be short and sweet. Of course, I say that as I am typing the intro page to this article 
and I really have no idea what points I am going to speak to here. The topic I do know: it's paging. Paging 
is a process by which you are able to chunk of record sets and present them to the user in manageable bites. 
Thus, if you have a table you need to look through and it has, say, 9000 records, you don't want to just 
throw all that data at your user. 
<p />
There are a couple of ways to page data ... on the DAL (Data Access Layer) or on the database itself. I am 
going to show you how to page any data in SQL Server. That way, if you do not want to or do not need to, you 
do not have to you EF or ADO to help managage your paging. 
<p />
Don't get me wrong: you are still going to have to manage a few variables outside of the database, but I think 
sending this work to the database makes sense. I know it makes my life easier. Okay, enough of the intro. Let's 
get to it.
