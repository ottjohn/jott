<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Look at the badge
of a Los Angeles police officer, and you'll see the iconic edifice many
associate with that department's headquarters. But it's not. That building is
actually City Hall, and it has the singular distinction of being the tallest
base-isolated structure in the world. Base isolation is the science of
separating a building from its foundation, inserting a carefully-engineered
layer between to dampen surface movement, which theoretically protects the
building above from tremors that would otherwise destroy it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The actual LAPD
headquarters building, unfortunately, was not built with such a careful
consideration to the science of plate tectonics and their seemingly whimsical
and catastrophic movements. Constructed in 1955, the Parker Center building,
located at 100 North Los Angeles Street, was erected at a cost of six million
dollars, fully two million under budget. When built, the eight-story, 400,000
square foot building dedicated an entire floor to what was at the time one of
the largest crime labs in the world. While functional, it certainly was not an
illustration of architectural grace and style, which is probably the reason it
had never really made it in Hollywood. After 50 years of service, time and
safety concerns crept up on the old building, so the Golden State put together
Proposition Q, a public facilities safety bond measure. Through that bond,
enough funds were accrued to construct a new building. At 10 stories, 500,000
square feet, and a cost of 437 million dollars, the new headquarters is nothing
less than spectacular. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Instead of the
stuffiness imposed by small offices and tight hallways, the new building offers
an open floor plan and natural lighting, accomplished by a mostly glass
exterior that insinuates itself into the space and light of the atmosphere
around it. The exterior of the building presents an edifice that looks more
like an art museum or a large university library than a structure serving as
police headquarters. It is at once a study in oppositions of materials and shapes:
concrete, steel, and glass provide the substance for an expression dominated by
rectangles, triangles, and asymmetric segmentation. The public entrance offers
the most dramatic view of the building: the right side is dressed up in
concrete slabs, a thin ribbon of glass centered vertically near its right-most
edge. The left side of the building succumbs stunningly and dramatically to a
glass exterior that appears to rush into the building from the right and bounce
back out on the left, protruding from the roofline by a good 50 feet, just far
enough to present an image of City Hall in its glimmering reflective surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
walked into the public entrance of the new LAPD headquarters, took an elevator
to the tenth floor, and walked into one of the building's many conference
rooms. In the center of the room was an oblong conference table sporting a
pressed wood surface. At the center of the table was a speaker phone, wired up
to six microphones distributed evenly around its circumference. At the far
right of the table was a small console that  controlled the room's multimedia
equipment. There were six chairs around the table, each composed of what looked
like dark gray netted canvas, which gave them the appearance of tiny, high-tech
hammocks. There were two walls made entirely of whiteboard and two
floor-to-ceiling windows that gave a spectacular view of the Los Angeles
skyline. Tobias took in the opulence with a mixture of confusion and
appreciation, then glanced at Sanchez as if to say, we're not in Pasadena
anymore. It was 10:15 in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By 10:30, all of the
principals for the meeting had arrived. Lieutenant Jacobsen from the fifth
floor made the introductions: Jacobsen was simply there to facilitate
fact-finding for the purpose of determining the best strategy for identifying
the person or persons who'd murdered Zach Hassenback. He sat at the front of
the table, a solid wall of whiteboard behind him. To his left, sat Dr. Randal
Kabinski, a staff psychologist who specialized in mental profiling of suspects
and victims of violent crimes. Directly behind Kabinski and a little to his
left was the projection of Special Agent Rathman, one of the many on-call FBI
profilers located at the Los Angeles field office located on Wilshire. After the
introductions, Jacobsen pressed the red record button in front of him, then
clasped his hands together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"As part of standard
procedure, I'm going to record this meeting. Obviously, feel free to take
notes. A transcript of this meeting will be available immediately upon its
termination." Then to Tobias, "Detective Tobias, I understand your team is
having some difficulty digging up solid forensic evidence for the Hassenback
murder. Is this correct?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes, sir. The intruder
appears to have gone to great lengths to eliminate any possible sources of
contamination, which has left us forensically challenged. Whoever this guy was,
he apparently has no respect for departments like ours. Typically, we require a
driver's license or at least a confession note to get started, and even then we
sometimes have problems solving our cases." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The others around the
table looked at Tobias and took the self-deprecating jab at his position with
good humor. Tobias had visited several times with both Lieutenant Jacobsen and
Dr. Kabinski in the past, and he knew they both enjoyed his off-center
perspectives of the circumstances that sometimes plagued investigations. The
projected image of Agent Rathman, however, looked a little perplexed by
Tobias's flippancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you actually <i>know</i>
so far?" He asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The tone of the
question made Tobias's neck muscles tense a little. A lot of the time, he knew
the FBI could be very helpful with cases like this; at other times, though,
especially when you didn't have a lot of information to work with, they could
be real pricks. Tobias looked to Sanchez, who'd tagged along as an observer,
gave him short dead-pan look, then turned toward the camera mounted in the wall
above the agent's projected image.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What we have, Agent
Rathman, is a lot of nothing. Our techs spent the better part of two days on
site, did everything but take duct tape to the whole mess. Every single print
lifted from inside of the house belonged to the vic. There's very little
collected fiber that cannot be attributed to materials already in the house.
The fiber not matching what's in the house amounts to little more than trace
amounts, most of which is more than likely contamination from materials brought
in underfoot …"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman interrupted,
&quot;at this point, detective, what we really need are statements of facts and
observations, not quick conclusions from your individual analysis,
notwithstanding their underlying well meaning." Rathman paused for effect,
staring out of the wall like a god pressed in whiteboard, then said, "Continue,
please."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias contemplated
Agent Rathman's image on the wall. He looked like a college professor, dressed
in a cheap tan jacket that was unbuttoned to show a crumpled light blue tie
swimming atop a starchy white shirt, the buttons of which were feeling the
undue stress of an expanded midsection. His face was scrunched as if in deep
thought, he had probably two days growth on this chin, a bulbous nose, furrowed
brows, and a heavy pair of thick glasses that obscured his eyes and weighed
down over his face. The entire assembly had the effect of making him look
almost intelligent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's really it, sir,
with respect to physical contamination," said Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You said almost all of
the fiber collected could be matched back to materials in the house?" Asked
Rathman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's correct." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Did your lab test <i>all</i>
of the clothes in the residence?" Rathman pushed his glasses up his nose with
meaty fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Negative. We tested a
sample of them. We would have tested all of them, but by the time we determined
the probable size of the assailant, we discontinued." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, so there's solid
evidence to suggest a wide disparity in size between assailant and vic?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias noticed Rathman
looked bored, as if he didn't really appreciate having to rehash facts already
spelled out in a report each of them had received and already read over. No one
really did. But it was necessary, and it sometimes revealed small holes in
procedure or flaws in strategy with respect to contaminant collection.
Different perspectives on the same data often lead to fresh directions in
pursuit, which was the reason they were all there in the first place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Correct." Tobias
answered. "From the damage caused by the forward roll on Hassenback's neck, we
estimated the assailant must be well over 200 pounds, probably somewhere
between 220 and 240."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman switched
from playing with his glasses to playing with his right earlobe, gave a small
sigh that signified he knew his line of questioning was probably less than
useful and most likely not going to reveal any gaping holes in procedure, but
he continued anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So the assailant
leveraged his weight on a forward roll from behind to break the vertebra at the
base of the victim's neck," Rathman stated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Most likely," replied
Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And given the
vic's relative size, his age, his position relative to his attacker, and his
obvious lack of readiness, your team estimated the likely weight range for the
assailant given the amount of damage to the vertibra and the surrounding
tissue." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Correct."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman leaned back in
his chair slightly, pushed his glasses back to the top of his nose, then stared
out of the wall and said, "Look, I really have no problem with the way the
evidence was gathered here. Further, I agree with the height and weight
estimates. I looked at the numbers myself. The broken clavicle and bruise to
the sternum support a weighted forward roll of the victim's neck. Combined with
a urgent forward motion, a guy weighing around 220 could easily cause that kind
of damage. Then there's the bruising on the jaw, after the rotational motion on
the neck, which happened after the forward motion. It was not digitized,
meaning no finger marks. A shorter guy would have left finger marks on the
victim's jaw. But there was only a single, long bruise toward the bottom, which
indicates the attacker was tall, had to use his thumb to leverage the rotation.
Given the numbers taken from the scene, I'd say he's perhaps in the six-three
to six-five range. In short, with respect to the physicality of our perp, I
really don't have any problems with what you came up with. Let's move on to the
lack of material evidence, review what you actually have, and then we'll decide
if it amounts to nothing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned back
in his chair, considered reminding Agent Rathman he'd already told him they had
nothing in the way of material evidence, thought better of it, and then
replied, "From the trace amount of cotton/polyester fiber we retrieved from the
body, especially around the jaw, we're certain the attacker was wearing gloves
made from those materials. The ubiquity of those types of fibers, however,
eliminates them as suspect filters. There was also a lesser amount of grey
polyester material at various spots on the carpet that doesn't match any
clothing owned by the victim. This material is used mostly in sportswear, like
sweat pants and jackets, but its proliferation in the marketplace again
eliminates it as a tool we can use to track recent purchases."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman looked at
Tobias, asked, "so you did the door-to-door?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's correct.
Nobody saw anything. So I guess we can take that to mean nobody saw a really
smart big guy running around the neighborhood in a grayish jogging suit
either."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman rolled his
eyes, shook his head as if personally offended. "What about the vinyl
flooring?" He continued. &quot;You cut out a piece,  right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Minor discoloration
that amounted to nothing more than chemical garbage, probably a mixture of food
coloring, grease, and dog poop. None of the surface area cut away retained anything
in the way of fibers or organics that we could use." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Anything else
we're missing from the evidence manifest?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We found one more
thing. A thumb drive. I brought it with me this morning. It should be with
Computer Forensics now," replied Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where did you
find it?" Asked Rathman, the intonation of which asked, <i>Why wasn't this
found during the initial processing of the scene</i>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We found it
behind a wall plate. No one noticed it at first." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So it obviously
belongs to the vic." The big head on the wall turned toward Jacobsen's side of
the table. "Any chance we can get that processed and have the results up here
this afternoon?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Guys in CF are
already on it," replied Jacobsen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Well,
gentlemen,&quot; Rathman said, &quot;looks like this is going to be
interesting. Without any available forensic evidence, we're going to have no
luck figuring out if this guy's in the system. Further, we have no avenue for
tracking him with recent purchases of goods and materials. All we know for
certain is the assailant was tall, large, and very smart about what not to
leave at a crime scene. I do have one admonishment, however." Rathman looked
toward Tobais.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Enlighten me, sir,"
Tobias said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I know you guys in
Pasadena are in love with your little lab down there, and I know it does a
pretty good job servicing the outlying communities. In this case, however, it
may be lacking the horsepower you need. I would recommend you take whatever
forensic evidence you have left and get it processed again at the lab in LAPD
headquarters. It is, after all, brand new and the best crime lab on the planet
outside of the FBI lab in Virginia." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Brought in this
morning," replied Tobias. He turned, gave Sanchez a look that broadcasted in no
uncertain terms to the kid it was going to be a very long day. He had no idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark glanced at a
printout of the document he'd found the night before, felt confident it held an
IP address. He took another sip of caffeinated tar, made a face as he swallowed
more grounds than coffee. He briefly wondered again if he shouldn't invest in a
coffee maker, then dismissed the thought. He took a bite of a protein bar, then
set both his coffee and his breakfast down on the dilapidated table that
supported his laptop. His computer was still crunching through Hassenback's
images. Prolific collectors of pornography. They all were. The numbers in the
email leapt from the page. Save for the zip code, there were four of them, and
each had a value between zero and 255:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Rate $209 per
month, fee of $158, 85 West La Brea, Suite 109. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>That's why he
included values from zero to 255 in his document searches. To find IP
addresses. Every IP address is composed of a set of four numbers separated by
periods, each of the numbers holding values between zero and 255. IP addresses
are used to uniquely identify a computer on a network, such as the internet.
Most people get around the internet using URL's consisting of domain names,
such as <i>google</i>, <i>abcnews</i>, or <i>espn</i>. But domain names are
simply alphanumeric abstractions of IP addresses, and in fact have to be
swapped out for their associated IP address before a connection to a requested
site can even be made. This happens through an entity called a Domain Name
Server, and the whole process adds time to the requested transaction. For
instance, typing http://206.159.68.112 into the location field of a web browser
would result in the website loading more quickly than typing its associated URL
built with a fully-qualified domain name, which might look something like
http://www.myfavoritewebsite.com. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>209.158.85.109. It
had been couched innocuously enough, and obviously if he hadn't been looking
for it, he wouldn't have found it. Not a chance. The rest of the email more
than likely presented an invitation for an exclusive membership to a brothel of
sorts staffed with children, all of whom were 12 years of age or under:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>San Andreas Bank has cultivated
a stable of new, very young funds, all of which have been in the market for 12
years or less … Our funds are all managed in-house, and all of your
transactions hosted on site!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the face of it,
the message could have been an actual invitation for an investment opportunity
with San Andreas Bank. The numeric values making up the IP address could have
been nothing more than what they represented. But there were three things that
convinced Clark otherwise: one, the message was sent from one pedophile to
another, and this is not the kind of conversation these types of people are
likely to strike up with one another; two, there is no San Andreas Bank; and,
three, the address listed does not exist anywhere in the Los Angeles area. With
that in mind, very little scrutiny of key pieces of the text pointed to an
obvious conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While his computer
continued to crunch away at searching through and organizing images from the
captured hard drive, Clark opened the control panel for his virus protection
software and set it to its highest level. Any time a machine is connected to
the internet, it's assigned a temporary IP address. That's how the magic behind
the internet works: open a website in a browser, and all the documents
associated with that site are streamed to the requesting machine, sent from the
IP address of the server hosting the site to the IP address of the machine
making the request through a browser window. Send a instant message from a one
machine to another, the alphanumeric chain is sent from the originating IP
address to the destination address. In other words, when a computer is
connected to the internet, it participates in both sending and receiving
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And that opens
connected machines to the possibility of attacks from malicious software stored
on questionable sites. Computers connecting without protection are ultimately
doomed to infection by worms and viruses that do anything from collecting
harmless information to making them a destination for storage of stolen or
nefarious media. But that's not all the bad news about connecting to the
internet: that temporary IP address assigned to the computer can also be used
to determine its approximate location, in much the same way a phone number can
be used. And the last thing Clark wanted at the moment was to be found, so he
launched an inexpensive program called IPLock, which would arbitrarily change
his IP address to make it look as though he were surfing from Malaysia or some
other obscure part of the world, rather than from a seedy strip just outside of
Los Angeles. Electronic prophylactics in place, Clark launched his browser and
typed http://209.158.85.109 into its address field, then clicked <i>go</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The web page loaded and
presented a well done corporate-looking design, which surprised him. A banner
sat at the top of the page with a decent looking logo for the fictional San
Andreas Bank on the left followed by a fault line that cracked and winded its
way to a pot of cash on the right. Jumbled over the fault line was etched text
spelling out the name of the bank. The whole banner was done up in desert
shades and captured the Central California geologic hue almost perfectly. Down
the left side of the screen was a dark gray rectangular menu. Its components
were black with centered, white text. Clark passed his mouse pointer over each
item. As he did, their backgrounds turned an eggshell white as the text color
changed to an off-black. There were five items in the menu: <i>Home</i>, <i>News</i>,
<i>Portfolio</i>, <i>Membership</i>, <i>About</i> <i>Us</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The main body of the
page was split into three sections. Its upper leftmost corner held a marketing
message that accurately regurgitated the highlights contained in the captured
document. Directly to the right of the message was the image of a
professional-looking woman. She wore smart-looking tortoise shell glasses
supported by a cute nose that separated two crystal-clear blue eyes. She had
long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, a pretty, toothy smile, and she
appeared to be contemplating something on a sheet of paper. It was clearly a
stock image used by thousands of sites all over the world, most of them
probably sales-related. The bottom of the page contained bulleted phrases and
words describing the bank's products, each item in the list marked on the left
by a tiny, family-oriented image. The page as a whole struck Clark as very
professionally done, nothing at all like most of the sites that pedaled the
flesh of children, or even adults for that matter. This had to say something
about the organization that ran the operation, something that deserved a little
more thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark hovered his mouse
pointer over the <i>About</i> <i>Us</i> menu item and clicked. As he expected,
his antivirus software dutifully alerted him that an unknown program was
requesting permission to write to his hard drive. Clark clicked on the warning,
forbidding the execution of the script. It could have been a virus bent on
wreaking havoc on his machine, but he really doubted it. The site itself was
more than likely a portal through which members communicated and set up
appointments, so the script requesting access was probably a program meant for
protection against unwanted scrutiny. And if it was a portal, then its users
probably paid a lot of money to use its services. Infecting their computers
with malicious software was the last thing the operators of the site would want
to do in that case. Clark thought about it a little more, figured the script
was built to check the IP address of the requesting computer against a manifest
of clients approved for access to the site. Clark suspected the program might
even have the ability to silently hijack video and voice software on the
requesting machine to gain a better understanding of who was visiting and
whether the visitor was the owner of an IP on the aforementioned manifest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He knew he'd
probably have luck with just a single menu item, so he clicked it. A half
second later, the membership page was presented within the site's content area.
It had a single line of text centered both vertically and horizontally within
its borders:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><i>Access
to this site can only be facilitated by logging on using your sponsor's
computer.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Smart. The site was
professional-looking, enough so to completely fool casual observers. It was
also armed with a script that likely had something to do with controlling which
computers and users could functionally attach to it, a gate-keeper so to speak.
Finally, the only way a potential member could gain access to the site was
through registration from the computer of the source who turned him onto it.
Very secure. But that shouldn't be a problem. He'd just have to find Eduardo,
the guy who'd sent Hassenback the email in the first place. Then he'd have to
hope like hell the man had made a connection with the organization behind the
website. Or that he knew of someone who had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was nothing
else to do with the site for now. He saw it. He was sure about its purpose. He
could go no further with it until he located Eduardo. He closed the browser
window, then spent the rest of the afternoon looking through the result set
returned from the search he unleashed on the copy of Hassenback's former hard
drive. The search had returned 14,657 images. Hassenback had archived some of
his images in a password-protected folder. His active images were contained in
another folder just under the root drive. It was named Projects, and each of
the images within the folder was misrepresented by a thumbnail depicting an
icon associated with a CAD (Computer Assisted Design) document. Smart for
hiding these types of files from the casual observer, not so smart for the want
of any kind of CAD software installed on his drive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark assembled a
random sample of fifteen percent of the images collected. He then meticulously
worked through them, trying to focus on the faces of the adults and children
while scrutinizing the image backgrounds for details. He knew he'd more than
likely never physically visit the scenes contained in the images, but he
studied them anyway: the way rooms were put together, the lack of or inclusion
of closet space, the type of electrical outlets, the condition and cost of
appliances and electronics, the color and composition of carpeting, the
material used on the walls, the quality of decorations. All of this information
gave him a sense of where and when the action had occurred: overseas, in
country, left coast, right coast, central, upscale neighborhood, urban blight,
and the approximate year of the setting. If he did happen to find a concrete
lead in one of the images, the ancillary information he looked for could give
him an idea about where he'd need to go for a follow-up. It was all very low
probability. But he did it anyway. Because there was a chance. And while there
was a chance, he worked to foster it into opportunity. It's all he could do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After several
hours of scrutinizing the images he'd selected, Clark worked his way down to
the last few. He'd found nothing. But he really hadn't expected a lead. The
lion's share of his progress from the very beginning had come from
interrogation and document searches, not images. But the value provided by a
potential hit on an image kept him going. It was like playing the lottery: he
knew he could do it for the rest of his life and find nothing. But if he did,
if he found a concrete clue within an image, it would change everything,
provide him with details he just couldn't get from documents and
interrogations. So whatever time table was required, he'd put in the work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark closed his
laptop, then leaned back in his chair. He was tired. He allowed his mind to
wonder. He thought about Carri, wondered if she was OK. He wondered when her
luck would run out with Chuck, wondered how long it would take the guy to find
her and then really make her life miserable. He wasn't really sure why he even
cared. His mind was racing and standing still at the same time. Maybe he just
needed a diversion. He knew he shouldn't, but he took out the card Carri had
given him, flipped open his pay-as-you-go phone, and dialed her number. </p>
