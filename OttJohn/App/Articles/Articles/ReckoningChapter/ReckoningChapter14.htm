<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took out his PDA
and opened the document that contained a copy of the marketing piece from the
fictional San Andreas Bank. He smiled to himself as he saw four numbers that
could clearly be put together to create an IP address. Massaging the digits
into the text had been clever. But not clever enough. He looked over at
Sanchez, who was focused on traffic. He had an uncharacteristically broad grin
on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?" Asked Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You did it again." The
grin grew into a twisted smile that curled up the left side of his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Did what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That
just-one-more-thing-ma'am thing you do. I know you get it by watching Columbo.
I bet you have a stash at your house and you take notes late at night. Am I
right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. I'm right.
Admit it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, I get it all from
Carol. She's the one who taught me all about pregnant pauses and terminating
key sentences with a sledge hammer. Without her, I wouldn't be nearly as
effective as I am." Tobias laughed, thought to himself that he'd honestly found
the Columbo shtick to be quite effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez drove past the
zoo, then used his blinker to signify to other drivers he was about to merge
onto the Santa Ana Freeway. Upon successfully inserting the unmarked into the
sea of aluminum that flowed southwest in the general direction of L.A., he
looked over at Tobias, hands gripping the wheel in a 10-2 position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So what brought about
that last line of questioning? To my caveman mind, it appeared unrelated."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It was. Honestly, I
just wanted to know how she was recording suspicious activity. I figured she
was putting it on the internet because of her use of the word <i>post</i>. I
think what she's doing is great, and I hope she at least gets some recognition
for it. If law enforcement agencies are going to adopt something like that,
though, it's going to have to be reworked so the data can be centrally
organized and accessed from anywhere. I'm sure she's aware of that, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So that's what made
you take off in a hurry?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Nope. It was the
address to her website. It has no domain name, which means you can only get to
it using an IP address. The address referenced in the bogus investment
literature is the same way. No domain name, just an IP address."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gripped the
wheel a little harder, his knuckles starting to whiten slightly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I didn't think there
was a URL referenced in that document. Is there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There is." Tobias
said, a little smugness in his voice. He checked the intonation, then
continued, "but it's not presented as one. It's wrapped up in the document,
part of a code, like we talked about on the way out. Jana's URL begins with a
209, and I think the URL for the marketing site does too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay. That's it. I
need to get back to school and take some general computer courses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good idea, kid.
Crime is moving more and more high tech, anyway. I heard they have a pretty
good program in computer forensics at the community college in Glendale.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, maybe I'll
look that up.&quot; Sanchez paused, then continued, &quot;so I'm assuming this
is what you're going to be working on tonight, figuring out the IP address and
the web site it's attached to?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yep."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Carol's going to be
pissed.&quot; Sanchez elongated the vowel in the terminating word, shook his
head in mock disapproval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So I'll compensate by
letting her get some of those damned porcelain nymphos."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez chuckled. "I
think you mean nymphs!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, that too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you want me to
concentrate on?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias thought for a
moment, noticed Sanchez looked haggard. The kid was tired, had been working his
butt off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I want you to
concentrate on going home, getting rest, and just being young."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No can do, boss," He
replied, relaxing a bit as he pulled into the parking lot of the station. "You
work; I work. How ‘bout I follow up with Agent Rathman and see what he's turned
up?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"If you can catch him,
that'd be helpful."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez parked and they
both exited the vehicle. As Tobias started walking across the lot,  he realized
he was missing something important. His car. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, kid!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Did we forget
something?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
Tobias chuckled. &quot;You picked me up at home, remember?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Shit.&quot;
Sanchez laughed. &quot;Just hop in my car, and I'll drop you. It's on my way,
anyway. I keep forgetting I live right up the street from you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, you should
really consider that!&quot; Tobias ducked into the passenger seat of Sanchez's
late model Ford Mustang and buckled himself in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, right,
boss. I'll do that right after I have my first million in the bank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias arrived
home a little past four in the afternoon. As he approached the concrete path to
his front door, he had the peculiar feeling he was being watched. He took a
single step onto the path and then saw the reflection of two shimmering eyes
glaring at him from below. He stopped, looked, and all at once saw a small
troupe of six porcelain nymphs, all strategically placed around freshly-planted
Agave and Baby's Breath, staring up at him. In spite of his negative banter
about their cost earlier in the day, he had to admit he was impressed with the
arrangement. Carol had a real gift, could probably even have her own cable
show. He smiled to himself and continued to the top of the walkway, made a
mental note to drag out his good camera and take some pictures to capture her
work it its pristine, uncrushed, and un-pilfered state. Tobias reached the
front door and stepped inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hello, Handsome!"
Carol greeted him with a glass of Petit Syrah. "My husband's going to be away
for the rest of the night; want to stick around and keep me company?" She
handed the wine to Tobias, batting her eyes, giving him her most sultry look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took the
glass, raised it to his lips. The earthy, berry-tinged flavor bathed his
tongue, interacting on a cultural-chemical level with his taste buds. He
swallowed the silky liquid and it splashed happily into his waiting stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he drank in his
wife's image, he couldn't help but think that after all these years, she still
had it, could still fire him up with same sort of ease one might light an
electric grill. She had gracefully moved past mid-life; in all honesty, much
more gracefully than he had. She was the same weight as when they'd first met;
still wore her hair in a cute, pulled-back ponytail, which showed only a little
more grey now. Where she once had smooth, flawless skin, she now had crow's
feet around her eyes and a hint of smile lines around her mouth. They were
definitely not frown lines. Tobias considered her proposition. A little role
playing sounded like a fabulous idea. It was something they'd engaged in
regularly to maintain a sense of adventure in their relationship. But he knew
he couldn't. The main mystery of the phony marketing letter having been
resolved, he'd be able to think of nothing else. He knew she'd understand, but
it took everything he had to decline her invitation anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Must be something
really important," she said, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Two hours. I
promise. No more. Electronically speaking, I'm in hot pursuit. I need to look
at some evidence, and then set up a strategy for tomorrow. Can you wait that
long?" He wrapped his arms around her waist, gave her a peck on the lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sure. You bet!
I'll just go back to the store and buy some more of those pretty little
porcelain toys!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias moaned,
gave her a mock frown, then gave her another kiss, this one lingering a little
longer than the last. "I won't be long. I promise."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias sat at the
little nook in his kitchen facing his computer, PDA in hand, notes from the
last several days scattered about haphazardly in front of him. He looked at a
printed copy of the phony marketing literature recovered from Hassenback's
thumb drive, decided his first order of business would be to figure out the
correct way to string together the numbers he suspected formed an IP address.
There were four numbers in all, which meant a total of 24 combinations, so he
figured his first half hour would consist of nothing more than punching numbers
into the location field of his browser and waiting for responses until he
either found what he was looking for or simply came up empty-handed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He entered his first
guess, which was simply a concatenation of the numbers in the order in which
they were presented: 209, 158, 85, 109. To his surprise, a page immediately
started to load. He felt a slight rush of satisfaction, but it was tempered by
the apprehension of what might show up on his screen. When the page finally
loaded, though, he found it looked nothing like what he'd expected: instead of
a page full of pre-adolescent pornography, it appeared professional looking,
something one might expect to find when surfing to the corporate homepage of a
small bank. It surprised him, but, then again, it really didn't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He looked over the
content of the main page, noticed it contained marketing script essentially the
same as that in the literature on Hassenback's thumb drive. Its suggestive
exposition about the age of the bank's funds and their associated in-house
management required little interpretive work for those who knew the piece for
what it was. Still, he was certain that unintended visitors to the site would
have no idea about its underlying connotation, would have no idea the site was
an electronic storefront for an organization specializing in pedaling the flesh
of young children. He shook his head, then reached for his glass of wine and
took a sip. The flavor bathed his tongue with an unaccustomed dullness, its
essence losing much of its appeal against the stark, incomprehensible reality
of the document glowing on his computer screen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He had to admit the
operation was smart, though: it steered clear of presenting grotesque imagery
of children in various states of undress and sexual situations. Every single
illicit site he had the displeasure of viewing in the past didn't do that,
instead choosing to bathe their pages in an assortment of shocking filth that
could only bring pleasure to those with severely aberrant psychologies. If they
were as careful with the rest of their operation, he figured it would be
difficult if not impossible to determine ownership in a timely fashion. He figured,
too, if time was something he could put in a gas tank, he'd be running on
fumes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He spent another hour
on the website, re-reading it several times to ensure he didn't miss anything
important. Besides a very clever recruiting method that required new members to
use the computer of an existing member to register, he found nothing. Almost
every single feature of the site was non-functional, perhaps as a security
measure against those who might beat the odds and accidentally stumble onto it,
odds he put at roughly one in four billion. The only other aspect of the site
that had caught his attention was a bulleted list at the bottom of the main
page: the bullets themselves were thumbnails of children's toys. There were
bears, pacifiers, blankets, dolls, monkeys, and baseball gloves. He understood
the images were placed there to appeal to potential and existing clients, a
marketing effort by the organization to communicate the age group in which it
specialized. He looked closely at a particular thumbnail in the lower left-hand
corner of the list. It was a pink, fluffy blanket that looked a lot like one
he'd purchased for Sarah when she was about three years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> He felt his face
flush, and his heart began to race. The thought of Sarah as a victim had occurred
to him often enough. His job kept such thoughts in the foreground more than in
his subconscious. But most of those thoughts had been associated with
preventative measures and protective behavior. What if that <i>had</i> been her
blanket? He wondered whose blanket it was, wondered if any or all of the images
on the screen were trophies. He reached again for his wine, gulping this time
instead of sipping. As he placed his glass back on the table, he wondered if
Sanchez was right. Maybe there was no point to solving the Hassenback case.
Maybe the bastard simply got what was coming to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He shook the offending
thought from his mind, quickly concluded the website had nothing more to offer
in the way of content. He then pulled up another page built and maintained by a
company called Network Solutions. It contained search utilities he'd used in
the past to gather information regarding website ownership and management. He
found the site's tools were very useful for delivering two key pieces of
information: the name of the company or person who registered the domain name
for a website, and the ISP that managed the website's IP address. Because of
the nature of the business, and because the site had no domain name, he held
out little hope of finding anything useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias clicked the <i>whois</i>
link in the upper left-hand corner of the page, entered the IP address for the
site, and clicked <i>search</i>. After a few seconds, the browser returned a
record that listed a business called Ripened as the ISP for the site, which
itself had a public-facing storefront at <i>castlebound.cz</i>. As he
suspected, though, ownership information for the site itself was missing: no
contact information, no phone numbers, no technical support. Too bad. The
little hope he had for finding some kind of registrant information evaporated
like a thin film of moisture on a hot slab of concrete. He shrugged, unfazed,
decided it was a long shot anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He clicked his
browser's back button, returned to the <i>whois</i> search utility, then typed
in the domain name for the ISP. This time he got what he was looking for: an
address, phone numbers, and an email for technical and general information. He
took a closer look at the address and noticed the organization simply listed a
P.O. Box. That was the good news. The bad news was that the address was in the
Czech Republic. He shook his head and cursed under his breath. Determining
ownership just got a lot harder, if not impossible. Certainly, he could call
the numbers listed, as he was confident they were legitimate. But he doubted
the people on the other end of the line would be very forthcoming when
confronted with questions about their involvement in hosting illicit material.
And he could forget about the court system: no doubt, a subpoena from the
Unites States was way out of its jurisdiction there. Tobias sat back,
frustrated. What he had didn't amount to much, but he guessed it was better
than nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He spent the next hour
thinking about three things: Hassenback's killer, Eduardo, and the website. For
most of his adult life, he'd prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. In
this particular case, however, he had no idea what was bad and what was good.
At least with respect to Eduardo. He ruminated on the concrete, mixing in a
little hypothetical: he was now in possession of a file that implicitly
detailed the presence of a well-run organization that catered to the sexual
desires of pedophiles. He had possession because Hassenback did, and Hassenback
received the file from a guy named Eduardo. But Hassenback got himself killed
by an unknown assailant, who also turned his house looking for information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So would it be a good
or a bad thing if the assailant also had the file? He figured that all depended
on timing: if the assailant was indeed in possession of the file, then he also
knew it originated from Eduardo. The assailant, though, had an advantage: he
had Hassenback's hard drive, which probably contained email addresses,
Eduardo's being one of them. If the assailant were in possession of the file,
and he were actively looking for Eduardo, that <i>could</i> be a very good
thing. If Tobias could find Eduardo first, that is. In that case, he could
offer Eduardo protection in return for his assistance in laying a trap for the
assailant. If he didn't find the guy in time, though, Eduardo would most likely
be in a great deal of danger. Or worse. And that would be a bad thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But if he could find
Eduardo first, he could provide an alternative and probably more promising
method for finding the organization that owned and operated the website: a
money trail. Certainly this was not something he could take on by himself, nor
could the LAPD for that matter.  Working through international banking
transactions was much more suited the talents of Agent Rathman and the FBI. In
spite of the resources he tapped, there was no doubt Eduardo was the key person
of interest in the investigation, and he needed to be located sooner rather
than later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned back in
his chair, grabbed for the lonely glass of Pinot his wife had poured for him a
little more than two hours before. He lifted it to his lips, and took the last
sip. As he looked at the empty glass, he thought about that certain point in
the evening, for him at least, when wine becomes counter-productive to almost
every endeavor except meaningless conversation, such as religious and political
discussions. Given his current rate of consumption, he figured his point of no
return was right around 8 PM. He looked at the clock. It was seven. He had
another hour, so he got up and poured himself another glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he returned to his
kitchen table, he again tossed around ideas about how to find Eduardo. He only
had a first name, and that wasn't very useful. He figured if he had the time,
he could interrogate the sexual offender community, but he knew that would
probably amount to a lot of nothing. They were typically very tight-lipped, as
dropping names on an offender who was steering well south of the law was
essentially admitting to guilt by association. He could only think of one
person who could give him the information he needed, and he was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> Or was he? He might be
dead, but he still had records, and those live on for quite some time after a
person dies. Hassenback obviously had an internet connection; therefore, he had
to have an ISP to whom he owed some kind of monthly payment. Tobias flipped
open his PDA and typed in a note to remind himself to return to the Hassenback
residence to look for an ISP bill or a bank statement that would show a record
of payment to an ISP. Once he determined the ISP, he could subpoena its
records, which might show him some level of detail about Hanssenback's internet
activity. He could then leverage that to determine the mail service he was
using, subpoena that company for its records, which might just yield Eduardo's
email address. Once he had that, he could use it to find Eduardo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias got up from his
chair and stretched, the soft white light in his kitchen bathing him in its
hazy, happy glow. He'd worked a little longer than he'd promised, but he had
some basic information uncovered, and he even had a strategy for finding
Eduardo. The real leg-work could wait until morning as most of that would
require judicial approval. He shut down his computer, cleaned his paperwork
from the kitchen table, and grabbed his wine. Exhausted, he trudged robotically
toward his bedroom, hoping along the way Carol wasn't too disappointed in him
for once again allowing his professional life to disrupt their loving home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark woke at two in
the morning. He'd gotten about three hours of sleep, figured too that he must
have been out pretty good. Because for a moment he was lost, thought he was
back in his old house, in his own bed, next to his wife, his daughter asleep in
the adjacent room. Then he remembered. It wasn't an unfamiliar sensation. And
most of his nighttime memories were good. So he'd learned to appreciate them,
to hold them close and take them for what they were: his only remaining
connection to a demolished family. He got out of bed, stood and  stretched
until his hands palmed the low ceiling above him. He held the position until he
could feel his muscles loosen and the blood begin to flow to the oxygen-starved
regions of his body. He lowered his arms, rolled his neck from side-to-side for
a minute, then moved on to his first order of business: coffee. Strong Coffee.
He prepared a batch using the brew Carri had purchased for him, thought again
about the compassion she'd shown him, the support. Then he turned away from the
contemplation to focus on the task at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As the diminutive
coffee maker chortled its way toward another pot of filmy sludge,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>he ripped the sheets off the bed,
then retrieved his briefcase and the bag of articles he'd purchased for the
morning's engagement. He then sat on the mattress and slipped into his first
layer of gear: a tight-fitting, full-body athletic ensemble designed for
running protracted distances in cool, humid regions. It was tight and it was
hot, but it was perfect for separating most of his body from the surrounding
environment. After putting on a cheap pair of cotton socks, he retrieved duct
tape from his briefcase, tearing off six eighteen-inch strips. He carefully
employed the adhesive to seal off the openings in his first layer of clothing.
He spent the next few minutes flexing and rotating his neck, wrists, and
ankles, adjusting the tape with each movement until he was satisfied his body
was sufficiently guarded against shedding contaminants. Satisfied he wasn't
leaking, he tugged on his slacks, put on his shirt, then fashioned a passable
Windsor knot for his blue, second-hand tie, which he decided to wear loosely
for effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After putting on his
boots and jacket, he hopped off the bed and moved to the coffee-maker, which
had finally quieted. A tantalizing aroma filled the room, stood in stark
contrast with the reality of the grainy, unpleasant flavor he knew would
accompany the first sip. And every sip thereafter. The little appliance sat
atop the dresser in steamy silence, seemingly exhausted from its work. He'd
grown fond of it for some reason. Perhaps because it seemed to speak to him as
it hacked and coughed out its brown phlegm. He'd stayed at a lot of weeklies,
and each had been equipped with similar appliances. But this one truly seemed
to put an effort into making really bad coffee. But he'd tolerated it. And
along the way, he'd figured perhaps it wasn't the coffee that was so important.
Perhaps it was the camaraderie. The commonality. They were both appliances, so
to speak. And they were both focused on a single objective: to do their best to
deliver their very worst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He filled same
Styrofoam cup he'd been using for several days, its customary white color long
obliterated by splotchy brown stains. He took a sip, frowned, retuned the cup
to the dresser, then moved back to the bed to retrieve a small bottle of
coconut-scented body lotion from his open briefcase. He squeezed a copious
amount into his right hand, rubbed it in to his hair and the exposed skin on
his body. While he liked the smell of the lotion and understood it was good for
protecting and even healing damaged skin, he didn't use it for that purpose.
Lotion can be used as a micro-adhesive, so it can also be employed to prevent
hair and dead skin from shedding and ultimately contaminating the places he
visited. It wasn't perfect, but he figured it gave the crime scene techs a lot
less to work with. As he finished rubbing the lotion into his hands, he took a
look in the mirror to ensure nothing was obviously out of place. He then
grabbed the rest of the gear he'd purchased the day before, picked up his
coffee and his briefcase, and headed out the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Twenty minutes
later, he was driving through the parking lot of the apartment complex. He
continued past Eduardo's pimped-out Vega, took a quick glance at his unit.
There appeared to be a dim light shining through the curtains of the window
that faced the landing of the stairwell leading up to his door. A light in a
window could mean a lot of things. It could mean Eduardo was awake. Or it could
mean he had stepped out and left the light on as a security measure. Maybe the
guy slept with the light on. As the window slipped out of his field of vision,
he noticed it flickered and changed color. It was a television. And that meant
Eduardo was probably up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He drove to the
south side of the complex, parked near an exit. He figured there was no sense
worrying about whether Eduardo was home, asleep, or awake. It didn't really
matter. The man had information he needed, and he was impatient for it. But he
remained in his truck. Staring out at the sporadic traffic moving about in
front of him. As he focused on the headlights moving from left to right, he
began to wonder if he hadn't made a mistake, wondered if he shouldn't have conducted
surveillance as he had with all of his former targets. Perhaps the one
observation wasn't enough. Perhaps it was an invitation to trouble. Then he
thought about Hassenback.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He suddenly felt a
need to leave, to return to his weekly and re-think his strategy. He put the
truck into reverse, then stepped on the brake. Things were different this time.
Had the police been involved in any of his first operations, they would've been
investigating mostly home invasion and assault complaints. Not something they'd
get too worked up about. Especially given the victims. But this time was
different. He'd killed Hassenback, and the police had more than likely made his
murder a priority. And he had no idea where the police were in the Hassenback
investigation. They could be right on his ass as far as he knew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In a perfect
world, he knew he should simply take the time to do the surveillance right. But
the world's far from perfect, and he was excruciatingly close to his goal. And
that's what mattered. He put the truck in park, convincing himself he had to
deal with Eduardo immediately. He took a deep breath, opened his door, and
stepped out in the warm morning air. He reached back into the passenger seat,
grabbed his briefcase, opened it, retrieved his portable police scanner, turned
it on, and diminished its volume slightly. As he locked his truck, he looked at
his watch. It was 2:45 in the morning. He turned and faced Eduardo's apartment.
The light continued to flicker from the curtained window. Eduardo was there. He
could feel it. He took another deep breath, let it out slowly, shook off any
remaining doubts, and headed for the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he neared the
stairs, Clark paused to glance at the names on the mail boxes at ground level.
After reading five labels, he found <i>E. Gutierrez, 233</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Eduardo Gutierrez</i>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He quietly climbed
to the second floor, stopping just short of Eduardo's door, an old, peeling
green thing that probably hadn't seen a paint brush in decades. Toward its top,
and just about dead center, was an after-market spy glass he figured might give
a fish-eye view of the landing. He took a half-step back to ensure he was out
of its field of vision, then took in the front of the unit. There wasn't much
to it. Besides the door, the apartment had a single exterior window that was
mostly shuttered by drapes thin enough to betray the dim, flickering light he'd
seen from his truck. He slowed his breathing, then spent the next couple of
minutes listening for sound. Besides the faint mechanical laughter coming from
a television, he heard nothing. Perhaps Eduardo wasn't home after all. Only one
way to find out. As he stepped toward the door and prepared to knock, he heard
the distinctive sound of a cough. It came from directly behind the exterior
window. Eduardo was home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And he was likely
awake. Which meant he'd lost his early morning tactical advantage. He
reassured himself it was still the best time to move, though, as most of
Eduardo's neighbors would be fast asleep. That was good for one main reason:
sleep-induced sluggishness muffled the sounds of struggle, which meant the
likelihood of witnesses would be diminished significantly. And there would
probably be some kind of struggle. Because if he lost his tactical advantage by
not catching Eduardo in a deep sleep, he'd have to leverage fear. If it came to
that. Clark twisted the knob on his police scanner to adjust the volume up and
then forcefully rapped on the door three times, causing its old, brass knob to
protest the unwelcome racket with a loose metallic vibration. His scanner
squawked loudly about a possible 211 in Glendale. He figured it was too much
noise, but he needed the radio racket to complete the illusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>No response. He
knew only seconds had passed, but it felt like minutes. As he raised his hand
to rap on the door again, Eduardo answered, a partially-illuminated silhouette,
caught up in the flickering light of a distant television. He was wearing
oversized jeans, flip-flops, a red, loose-fitting tank top, and a string of
Puca shells wrapped tightly around his neck. His hair was black,
shoulder-length, very curly, and still swept back in a tight  pony tail. He had
a lit cigarette in his right hand, his other positioned above his head, pressed
against the inside of the door. He looked at Clark with brown, beady eyes, set
close within a very narrow head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes, may I help
you?" The first word was inflected, making it sound more like <i>jes</i>. As
Eduardo waited for an answer, he let out an involuntary yawn, then took a hit
of his cigarette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Mr. Gutierrez?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes." He returned
his cigarette to his lips, took another quick puff. Clark's scanner squawked
loudly in his left hand, catching Eduardo's attention. For the briefest of
moments, Eduardo's eyes went from beady to wide then back to beady.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm Detective
Randolph with the LAPD. I need to ask you a few questions, sir." Clark flashed
his three-dollar badge. Eduardo held his ground, but his eyes got a little
wider. He took another drag of his cigarette, looked over Clark's shoulder and
asked,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What's this
about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just a few
routine questions regarding compliance with the terms of your parole. I promise
this won't take long."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I don't
understand. You're not my parole officer. And why are you here at this hour?"
He said it with his brows furrowed, his tone hushed so as not to disturb his
sleeping neighbors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, sir, I'm not
your parole officer. I'm part of a taskforce working with parole enforcement. I
apologize for the late hour, but we've had some incidents in this area over the
past couple of weeks, and we've been working 24/7 checking things out. Now if
you'll let me in the door, sir, I'll ask you the questions I have, and then I
can be on my way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked over
Eduardo's shoulder into his apartment. As he suspected, the front of the unit
contained a small, cramped living space. Toward the middle of the room, he
could make out the left edge of an ugly orange couch set behind an even uglier
plastic coffee table. Behind the couch was a small eating area built into a
half wall that separated the kitchen from the living room. In front of the
wall, pushed up against the eating area, were two plastic patio chairs. Dirty
laundry was strewn about an olive-colored shag carpet. In the background, he
could hear the television broadcasting Hispanic programming. The smell of cigarette
smoke and stale beer wafted out of the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I can answer your
questions here, can't I?" Eduardo asked, apparently hoping to keep Clark out of
his apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That suits me,
Mr. Gutierrez." Then, more quietly, "If you really want to bother your neighbors
in the middle of the night with a line of questioning that'll reveal your past
activities and recent incarceration, I'd be more than happy to proceed right
here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Eduardo made a
show of contemplating his options, Clark took a moment to assess his own
situation: he'd been at the door for just about two minutes, and no one had
joined them. Further, he was certain the only sounds were coming from his
scanner, his conversation with Eduardo, and the television. Which meant Eduardo
was more than likely alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Can I meet you
somewhere? Like your office or something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo's eyes
shifted; he released his words haltingly. It was obvious to Clark the man had
something to hide. Which was good. Maybe it was something he could leverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, sir, I'm
here <i>now</i> and you're here <i>now</i>, so it really doesn't make much
sense to reschedule, does it?" Clark's radio cackled loudly, this time
squelching about a possible homicide in Santa Ana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo's eyebrows
bridged slightly, betraying panic. He seemed to be reaching for something,
anything. He thought a little more, then said, "Dude. I wanna help you but I
gotta go to work, man. My shift starts in like thirty minutes. If I take time
for this now, I'll be late. You understand? I can't afford to lose my job."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was a lie,
broadcast by body language. Eduardo was facing away from him, almost at a
ninety degree angle. He had to admit, though, it could have been a defensive
posture. But eyes never lie. And Eduardo's  shifted up and to the right as he
spoke, which told him the man was definitely inventing most of what was coming
out of his mouth. He decided to take a calculated risk, confident he was right:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "I can call your
employer. If you filled out your application appropriately, he knows you're a
felon, and he'll understand you'll have to do things like this from
time-to-time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo frowned,
grasped at one last straw. "Why isn't Danny doing this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "You're not his
only parolee, sir, and this isn't his job anyway. The sooner we get inside, the
sooner I can ask my questions. Let me in, and we can talk. We can get this over
with, you can go back to what you were doing, and I can be on my way, okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark had been
standing at Eduardo's door for too long, perhaps a little more than four
minutes. In spite of the hour, he figured the odds of someone seeing him were
starting to grow, moving from doubtful to likely. And he couldn't have
witnesses. He'd have to be in the apartment interrogating Eduardo in the next
few seconds or abandon his current strategy in favor of abduction, which would
delay his progress for at least another couple of days, something he couldn't
afford to do. He took a small step toward the entry, so his left foot was
planted a few inches from the bottom of the door. Eduardo noticed the subtle move,
took another drag of his cigarette, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wait here. I
wanna call Danny, see if he ..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before Eduardo
could finish his sentence, Clark secured the open door with his foot, covered
Eduardo's mouth with his right hand, and placed his left hand on Eduardo's
right shoulder, jamming his thumb into the man's armpit for leverage. Then he
pushed. He drove Eduardo past the door and into the living room, kicking the
door shut with his leg as he muscled the smaller man until his back was pressed
against the seating area that divided his kitchen from the living room. He held
his hand over Eduardo's mouth for a moment longer, cranking his head back and
twisting it to one side.  The take-down had burned about three seconds,
generated very little noise. He held his breath and listened anyway. No sounds.
No footfalls. No doors opening and closing. So probably no anonymous calls to
9-1-1. He slackened his grip around Eduardo's mouth, tilted the man's head
forward just a bit, but held him firmly in place. He then tried one more time
to pull off the Detective disguise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Mr. Gutierrez,"
he said forcefully but quietly, "you're now interfering with an official police
investigation. If I have to, I'll arrest you and drag your ass to jail.
Cooperate, and I'll forget any of this happened." Clark removed his hand,
backed away from the wall, allowing Eduardo to recover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you
want?" Eduardo's words almost shook out of him, his defiant disposition
replaced with what now appeared to be fearful compliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I told you. I'm
part of a task force that's working on collecting information to identify and
dismantle organized groups that commit crimes against children. There's been
activity in this specific area, so we're shaking down convicted sex offenders
to gather information that might help us make an arrest.&quot; Clark paused,
let Eduardo process what he'd said. Then he looked the man squarely in the
eyes. &quot;But keep in mind, Mr. Gutierrez, if you don't change your attitude,
you'll be going to jail. Understand?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo slumped
his shoulders forward, looked down to the ground. "Yeah. I can't help you,
though. I'm clean. I don't know nothing about that stuff anymore." He shook his
head back and forth as he spoke, his hands raised defensively in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark backed up a
little to give Eduardo more space, then took another look around the apartment.
The orange couch was more like a love seat, probably from the sixties. Beside
it was a blue plastic milk crate employed as an end table. It supported an old
lamp, its shade lost long ago. On the outside wall across from the couch were
three things: A window covered by a large, blue bed sheet, a small television
on another milk crate, and an old desk that supported a newer-model computer.
It was on, and the corner of its screen betrayed fleshy skin tones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're lying
Gutierrez."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No. No lies. I'm
telling ..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We've been
tracking you online."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, right. If
you had, then you'd know I haven't done <i>nothing</i> wrong."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took the
portable scanner out of his pocket, turned the volume off, then threw it on the
couch. Eduardo remained motionless, still leaning up against the half-wall.
Clark thought about the facility that held his daughter and Eduardo's
connection to it. He'd been there. Unless he'd lied to Hassenback. That was
definitely a possibility, and it was something he needed to find out. Quickly.
Then something else slipped into his mind: Eduardo and his daughter. In the
same context. Had the filthy scum visited the facility while she was there? Had
he ...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> He suddenly felt
his blood begin to boil, felt an overwhelming urge to dispatch the diminutive
man in front of him. He wondered how many other children the facility held, how
many others it'd used up and dumped in the desert, victims of an industry
focused on satisfying the deviant sexual cravings of pedophiles. He took a deep
breath, then exhaled slowly. He couldn't allow himself to commit the same
mistake he'd made with Hassenback. Information first, then kill. Not the other
way around. He pushed the thoughts aside, stuffed them into a fragile corner of
his mind, the place that held all the material for every nightmare he'd had
over the past couple of years. Then he motioned to Eduardo's computer screen
and said two words that made the man's face lose all its color.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i> </i>&quot;Hassenback,
asshole.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Shit. Shit.
Shit." Eduardo took a quick glance at his computer, any vestige of defiance now
clearly replaced with fear and panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We have evidence
he's been active in the area. Look, we're not after you. We just need some information
so we can bring him in."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Ok. But I'm not
sure how I can help."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I just need to
ask you a few questions. That's all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sure. You promise
I'm not gonna go back to jail? I can't go back there, man. It'd kill me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Nothing you say
here will lead to an arrest." Wasn't that the truth?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo hesitated
for just a moment, took a drag of his cigarette, then appeared to relax a
little. "Okay, man, I'll tell you what I can."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark held up a
single forefinger, indicating to Eduardo that he should stay put for the
moment. He then walked to the middle of the living room to retrieve his
briefcase. During their struggle, he'd tossed it there to get it inside and out
of his way. He placed the briefcase on the ugly orange couch, opened it,
removed his laptop, then motioned for Eduardo to have a seat on the floor in
front of him. As Eduardo moved to the front of the apartment, Clark lifted the
lid of his laptop, fired it up, and opened a document outlining the basic
questions he asked all of his targets. He then thought about what his first
question should be. Because it wouldn't be any that were itemized in the
docment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was three in
the morning. Rick had long ago parked the Jag. He was now driving an Escalade,
which was a sweet ride. In between, he'd been in a Bronco and a Taurus. He'd
been running the circuit for almost 18 hours straight, and he was tired.
Caffeine was beginning to lose its efficiency, and Jason, motor mouth on and
nonsense gushing out of his pie hole like a non-stop geyser, was sitting next
to him jabbering on about his next big score. Pot. The moron had actually tried
to light up in one of the vehicles about a week earlier, and Rick had found it
necessary to explain to him that in their line of work that wasn't exactly a
smart thing to do. No smoking weed in the car. He'd made the rule there and
then. But he'd allowed the idiot to get high during breaks because it shut him
up. Mostly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What the fuck you
think we're still rolling out here for?" Asked Jason. "I mean, it's three in
the fucking morning, right? What the hell are we gonna to see or pick up at
this hour?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Fuck if I know.
Boss man wants us to do something, though, we just do it. Don't ask questions
like that. We get paid well enough, so let's just do our fucking jobs." Rick
had only been on board for six months, but during that time he figured the
organization to be well-funded, given what he got paid and the size and quality
of their fleet. Almost everything they did, too, was planned very carefully
and executed skillfully. When everyone was on the same page. And that didn't
always happen. There was too much of a disconnect between the brass and the
grunts. And no matter how well a plan is laid out, that sometimes lead to
problems. Nothing serious since he'd been working for them, but he'd noticed
the potential for disaster almost immediately. And with the quality of grunts
they hired, he figured a first-rate disaster was only a matter of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick looked at the
road ahead of him, trying to concentrate as he negotiated the darker corners of
the upper class neighborhood he was driving through. Jason wasn't helping. His
barrage of useless verbiage seemed unending. Unstoppable. He had an
overwhelming urge to smack the man, beat him into silence. Then he had an idea.
Maybe it would even work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jason.&quot;
He said it in a conversational tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick put his right
forefinger to his lips, then pointed to the speakers and mouthed out <i>bugs</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jason gave Rick a
confused look, then cracked a crooked smile and nodded his head as if he were a
part of some big secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Oh. Right. I
gotcha.&quot; He winked and then went into a conspiratorial silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Maybe it would
work, but Rick doubted it. He felt that keeping Jason quiet was probably about
a easy as plugging a fire hydrant with a sponge. He pegged the man as nothing
more than a fucking moron who could drive and handle a gun fairly well. Other
than that, he couldn't see a practical use for the him. He had no idea how he
wound up pulling duty with him, either, or how he had gotten employed in the
first place. One of these days, he was certain, the idiot was going to get them
both killed: Jason had a big problem with self-control, mostly with what he
said. And he didn't have a mouth, either. It was more of a sound hole, through
which stupidity gurgled and flowed. He figured one of these days he'd have to
take care of him before it caused some real damage, sooner the better. No sense
allowing an imbecile to endanger <i>his</i> life. <i>Oh. Right. I Gotcha. Wink,
wink!</i> Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He took a breath,
tried to regain his focus and center his Chi. Jason had somehow managed to stay
quiet for more than a minute, and he was enjoying the peace. Until the phone
rang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Rick. Talk."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You two still driving?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim again. One
of the strangest things about this gig was that he'd never met the boss, only
spoke to him once. The only guy he'd had consistent conversation with was Manheim,
who was in charge of business operations. He'd never seen or even spoken to the
chief of security. That suited him just fine, though. Manheim was one smart son
of a bitch, although he was a little too anal about protocol. He also seemed to
be the only guy who understood the quality deficit in some of the grunts they
hired. But he guessed that had to be one of the pitfalls that came with the
territory: how does one go about hiring quality people for a business with such
a depraved objective?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Yes sir. How
much longer should we stay on? We've been at this for about 18 hours now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Hate to tell
you this, buddy, but the boss is going to be staying out here probably well
into tomorrow, perhaps even the next day. We've had some turnover, so we're
going to need some inventory replenishment here soon. You holding up okay?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Yeah, we're fine.
We'll just go to a sleep/wake pattern, take turns driving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Sounds like a
good idea. Just keep at it, and I'll make sure you get a bonus out of this.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Emboldened by the
prop, Rick hazarded a suggestion: &quot;we have inventory available. We could
procure ... &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick flinched
involuntarily as the voice on the other end of the line interjected forcefully.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i> That would be
a big mistake. Your job is to survey the product, not to acquire it. Doing
something like that could lead to termination, and we don't want that, do we?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "No sir." Rick
stammered. He knew termination wouldn't mean getting fired. It would mean
getting dumped into a mine pit somewhere to become food for worms. "Won't happen
..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You bet your
ass it won't happen again! Do me a favor, Ricky. Don't make suggestions. When
you're on the clock, don't even have a fucking thought unless we put it in your
head for you. You know why we're so successful?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes sir," Rick
replied, knowing he was going to get the answer anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Because we got
a lot of smart people working for us who know how to plan and execute. Our
brass has cred that reaches from ivy league schools to the military. We know
how to run this shit, so we definitely don't need any suggestions from you. You'd
be wise to remember that!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes sir." Rick
fell silent, hoped to hell he hadn't screwed up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Look, I don't
want to be an asshole, Ricky. I want to keep the morale of my troops high.
You're doing a good job. Keep it up. We need more guys like you. In fact, we're
going to use you for replenishment, which means a nice bonus. Just know who you
are, accept it, and do only what's in your job description.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thanks. Sorry for
the infraction. It won't happen again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>No problem. Now
get back on task.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick slapped the
phone shut. He didn't look at Jason. For the first time since he'd taken the
job, he was actually fearful for his life. The money he was making was good.
