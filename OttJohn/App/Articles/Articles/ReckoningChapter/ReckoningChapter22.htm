<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The last remaining man,
the boss, had thrown his weapon well in front of him, flung it about twenty
feet. Clark and Tobias approached him from opposite sides, carefully, firearms
trained on him all the way. When they were certain there were no other
immediate threats, Clark made the guy lay face down on the ground. He placed
his right foot on the man's neck, removed the nylon rope from Tobias's wrists,
then pressed his knee into the man's lower back and used the rope to bind his
hands together tightly. He tested the knot, decided it would hold, then pulled
the man up from the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's your
name?&quot; Clark demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;None of your
fucking business! You two are in a shitload of trouble, you know that? Come on
to my property and shoot up the fucking place like it's some kind of vid
...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stopped the man's
tirade with a vicious backhand to the face, which returned him to the ground.
Clark helped him up again, then re-iterated his question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's your
name?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man looked up at
him, eyes wide with contempt. He instinctively tried to move his hands to his
face to massage his freshly-bruised jaw. But he couldn't. He licked his upper
lip, spat out the blood deposited there from his right nostril. For a moment,
Clark thought he was going to continue with his threats, but then he cast his
eyes downward, and his shoulders relaxed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I was only trying
to protect my property.&quot; He looked at Tobias. &quot;Didn't want to get the
cops involved; didn't mean for any of this shit to happen. My name's Gerkowitcz,
Dean Gerkowitcz.&quot; He said it softly, laboriously, as if the air had been
let out of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, Gerkowitcz,
we're going to take a short walk to my truck, then we're going to drive back to
your place, and then you're going to give us a tour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz said
nothing, so Clark shifted his attention to Tobias. He was standing just to his
left, massaging the raw skin on his wrists. His face was cut up with
lacerations, and his left eye was beginning to swell shut. Other than that,
Clark figured he looked okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The walk to the truck
took less than ten minutes. Tobias claimed the passenger seat while Clark
stuffed Gerkowitcz into the rear cab, face down on the bench seat. He slammed
the door on the corpulent man, climbed into the captain's chair, then fired up
the big diesel for the drive back to the facility. Besides the labored
breathing coming from Gerkowitcz, the return trip was filled with a deafening
silence. Clark didn't feel  the need to say anything. There'd be enough talking
later. He figured he'd do what he'd planned with Gerkowitcz, then keep his word
and hand himself over to Tobias. What else could he do? They knew who he was.
He could run, but they'd find him. He might be able to evade for a few months,
maybe even a year. But he'd have to look over his shoulder constantly, hide
everywhere he went. He'd lived a life of preventive evasion for almost two
years, found it wasn't the kind of existence he lusted after. If he gave
himself up, maybe they'd give him life, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he drove a
circuitous route back to the front of the property, the buildings once again
came into view. Clark found an unimproved side road into the gravel parking
area that fronted the main building, then stopped the truck just short of its
concrete steps. As he placed the truck in park, he looked over at Tobias,
noticed the man was sweating a little and his face had gone pale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You okay?&quot;
He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias rubbed the beads
of sweat away from his forehead. &quot;Not really, Clark. I lost my partner
today, we just passed the spot where that big son of a bitch pushed his rifle
barrel into the back of my head, and I'm beat all to hell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The response rang with
stinging irritation. Clark could think of nothing to say, so they sat in
silence for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked out the
passenger window, lowered his voice to barely above a whisper. &quot;Sorry.
It's been a rough day to say the least. But I'll survive. Besides, we have more
important things to worry about than how I'm doing.&quot; He motioned with his
head toward the door of the building in front of them. Clark acknowledged the
taciturn objective with a nod of his own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You fire off all
the rounds in that handgun I threw you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias picked up the
Steyr, ejected the clip, then held it up for inspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I have eleven left.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That should be
sufficient. I doubt there's anyone left. Pretty sure these guys shot their load
with that last press; but just in case, let's not take any chances. Chamber a
round, and let's go in weapons drawn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Clark exited
the truck, then Clark opened the driver's side rear door of the crew cab and
pulled Gerkowitcz out from the back. He turned the man around, looked into his
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where do you keep
them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz hesitated
for a moment, as if he were weighing his options. Clark noticed he was standing
more erect; he no longer looked defeated. There was an arrogance there, but it
was mixed with a palpable nervous energy that seemed to seep from his pores,
flood out of his body with the prodigious amount of sweat that was now soaking
his clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Keep who?&quot;
He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The girls.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz put on a
look of surprise and bewilderment. &quot;I have no <i>idea</i> what you're
talking about. If you'd have let me finish what I was saying earlier, I could
have explained everything. This whole fiasco was a God damned misunderstanding!
My fucking chief of security thought you boys were a rival mining outfit,
industrial spies sent out to hassle us. We've had problems with them before, <i>violent</i>
problems. A whole bunch of my men got beat up and put in the hospital just a
few weeks back because of their shit. That's why there's hardly anyone
here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you're a
mining outfit?&quot; Clark deadpanned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, God damn it!
This whole fucking mess is one big <i>fucking</i> mistake!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you've been
hassled by this rival outfit; you figured we were with them, so you simply did
what you had to do to protect yourself and your crew?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's what I've
been trying to tell you! Now if you don't release me, I'm going to lawyer up
and sue the shit out of the both of you! Now God damn it untie me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>With each syllable,
Gerkowitcz appeared to grow more confident. The nervous energy Clark had
noticed only a moment ago appeared to have ceased altogether. He looked around
the grounds. It was a large property, and he knew the girls wouldn't be stashed
anywhere obvious, even in a place like this out in the middle of nowhere. He
could search the place, tear it down board-by-board, but he wanted closure
quickly. The day hadn't yet reached its hottest point, and he wanted to wrap things
up before that if he were going to follow through with what he'd planned. So he
walked around Gerkowitcz, grabbed a stubby forefinger, then bent it back until
it snapped. The man let out a howling scream, crumpling to his knees in pain.
Clark walked back around him, gently lifted his face so they were looking
eye-to-eye.,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Listen, asshole,
you've got four more fingers left on your right hand, and you've got five
remaining on your left. I'd be more than happy to spend the next few minutes
breaking them one by one until you tell me where you're keeping the girls. This
is a big place; I don't have a lot of time. So why don't you make this easy on
the both of us and just tell us where you're keeping them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The rest of
Gerkowitcz's fingers remained unharmed, and after he lead them to the shelter,
Clark set about doing three of the four things he'd planned to do before
leaving: isolate the clients, secure the girls, and if it were still around,
retrieve his daughter's stuffed bear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> There were only three
customers remaining, each locked in his own room with a girl. As Tobias kept an
eye on Gerkowitcz, Clark removed the men, placing them one by one into an empty
room and locking it from the outside. Two of them had demonstrated a lack of
judgment and resisted, and both had received injuries that would require
hospitalization before finding new accommodations in prison. When he was
finished, Clark once again took possession of Gerkowitcz, which freed  Tobias
to round up the girls and begin the process of identifying them and reassuring
them they'd be home soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The bear was in a
makeshift meeting room to the rear of the shelter. It was in a glass display
case with about ten other items that had been collected from girls Gerkowitcz
had conscripted as sex slaves. When he saw it, he could barely contain himself.
He wanted to tear the place apart, mop the shards of broken glass from the case
with Gerkowitcz's face. But he knew he couldn't do that. He might damage the
other mementos, and those were items the surviving girls might want back,
something the parents of the girls who didn't make it might want to keep as
reminders. And he wasn't going to kill Gerkowitcz, either. He had other plans
for him. So he simply retrieved the bear, then walked Gerkowitcz back through
the great room, pushing him quickly past Tobias and the girls. The less they
saw of the man, the better. He walked him out of view behind a shed in the
middle of the room, had him lay face down on the floor, then placed his boot on
his neck to keep him from moving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias was the reason
he didn't have to complete the forth item on his list. He'd planned on calling
Carri, planned on waiting for her until she showed up to watch the kids until
the authorities arrived. But he didn't need to do that now. And he was
conflicted about that. He wanted to see her again, even though it would've been
difficult, even though they would've had to say goodbye one more time. But it
worked out best for her. She wouldn't have to get caught up in the mess. He
pivoted on his foot, slightly grinding into Gerkowitcz's neck as he did. The
fat man protested feebly, and from his reaction, Clark figured the fight was
mostly out of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tobias!&quot;
Clark called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias walk around the
shed and stopped just short of Clark, body angled so he could still see the
girls. He looked much better than he had just minutes before. Finding the girls
was definitely a plus for him, gave him something to keep his mind from the
nastiness of the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We're heading out
now. I just need a few hours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You have a
cell?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hang on for a
second.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias disappeared
around the corner, then returned a moment later with a notepad and a pen. He
wrote his cell number down, tore the sheet from the pad, folded it, and handed
it to Clark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I owe you my
life, Clark. You saved my ass out there today. Twice. The least I can do is
give you some lead time. I owe you that. If you want to run, you go ahead and
do it. I'll tell you this, though: life on the lamb isn't fun, and one of these
days, you'll get a little careless, and you'll get picked up. But I'm not going
to push this and make you turn yourself in. Not after this. But if you <i>are</i>
going to run, get out of state. Hell, get out of the country if you can. But
don't stay anywhere near here. If you want to turn yourself in, call me. I'll
pick you up myself. It'll be painless and discreet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark allowed himself a
single, brief grin. Then it was gone. He'd been prepared to go to prison. But
he'd lied to himself about taking four stone walls over freedom, any kind of
freedom. He'd allowed his mind to wander, to contemplate the possibility, to
try on the idea like a new shirt. But he knew that's all it was. Given the
choice, he'd run. Given the window of opportunity provided by Tobias, he'd take
it. He looked at the officer, didn't know what to say.  After a moment of
getting used to the idea of walking away, he finally put together a reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias just nodded,
then stuck out his hand. Clark took it in his, pressed it firmly, then turned
to walk away. As he steered Gerkowitcz toward the hatch, the man finally broke
his silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where're you
taking me?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nature
walk.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd read a news
article online almost two years before about a guy, an athlete, who thought
he'd try to cross Death Valley with just a quart of water. In the middle of the
summer. He'd almost made it, had come as close as a quarter mile from where
he'd parked his car. A group of tourists had found his body the same day. The
article claimed the autopsy report stated the man had lost almost sixty pounds
during his trek. In a matter of hours, he'd had the water sucked right out of
him. He'd been mummified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It seemed like a
fitting end for the monster who'd caused the death of his daughter, had left
her out in the desert to die like an animal. And it would be torturous. It
would all start with an incredible, unforgiving thirst, the discomfort of which
would quickly be compounded by superheated skin, a racing heart, and delirium.
Death would come, but it would an agonizingly slow process. It would give the
bastard a few hours to think about what he'd done to his daughter, and all the
other little girls he'd abducted and abused. He knew too, though, that after
some time, he'd change psychologically. He'd lose himself, become mad from heat
stroke. And then probably an hour later he'd be dead. To make things more
interesting, Clark had decided to dial up the pain a little, give him a canteen
spiked with laxative. So along with the overwhelming distress from exposure,
he'd have to deal with accelerated dehydration and painful stomach cramps as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He drove into the
desert for a good hour, found a spot in the middle of a flat valley that spread
out about twenty miles in all directions. It's surface was colored white with
alkaline, and the air above it shimmered with heat, distorting what lay beyond
it. He looked at the digital clock on his console. It said 2:38 PM. The outside
air temperature gauge next to it reported 110 degrees. He figured the valley
floor had to be about ten to fifteen degrees hotter. As he exited his truck, he
was sure he was right. The air was oppressive, and the desert scalded his feet
even through his boots. He went around to the passenger side rear door, opened
it, and dragged Gerkowitcz out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What are you planning
to do with me?&quot; The boastful man he'd been was gone, his pompous exterior
now replaced with an outward composure wrapped up in fear and self-concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark simply looked
through him. &quot;Nature walk. I told you. I just need one more thing from
you, and then you're free to go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's
that?&quot; Gerkowitcz was visibly shaking, as though he were freezing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Your
clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I can't.&quot; He
began hyperventilating. His shaking worsened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You can, and you
will,&quot; Clark paused. &quot;Then you can walk out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz just looked
at him, uncomprehending. He cast his gaze into the desert. His eyes shot wide
with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why are you doing
this?&quot; He paused, lowered his head as if he already knew the answer to the
question. Then he looked up quickly, his face suddenly lit up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I've got money.
Loads of it. I'll give you all of it. Anything you want. Just please don't do
this. I have a ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He started wheezing,
sniffling. His expression changed, now cast with a cold understanding, a
realization of a truth he was trying desperately to avoid. Then the tears came,
exploded from his face, landing on his shirt and saturating it with salty
dampness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But ... &quot; He
paused again. &quot;I have a family. I have a daughter. I'm never going to see
her ... &quot; He choked. &quot;I'm never going to see her again. I have
to.&quot; The last words barely escaped from his mouth, riding into the air in
a lightly pitched whine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark moved closer so
his face was only an inch from Gerkowitcz's. He reached around the man's girth,
grabbed the middle finger of his left hand, and that was all it took. Two
minutes later, he was unbound, undressed, and standing naked in the desert. The
only thing he had to protect him from the sun was a one-quart canteen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark got back into his
truck, fired it up, and began backing away. As he did, Gerkowitcz made a
desperate run toward the driver's side door, screaming all the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No! No! I have to
say goodbye! No! Please. Stop!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stopped, rolled
down his window. Gerkowitcz quickly grabbed the door. His eyes were bloodshot,
he was bouncing from one foot to the other, trying to keep the hot desert from
burning him from the ground up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Please.&quot; He
begged. The tears had stopped. He just looked desperate, overwhelmed.
&quot;Please. Take me back. Let them put me in jail. I'll do anything. Just let
me see my daughter. I have to say ... &quot; He choked again. &quot;Oh God. I
have to say goodbye.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's the one
thing any parent would want to do, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes. I'm so
sorry. But you understand. I'll take prison. I'll take the death penalty. I
take anything you want. But I have to say goodbye. Please.&quot; His words came
out fast, riding atop heavy, labored breathing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Funny how things
fall into perspective when you know you're never going to see the one person
who gives your life meaning ever again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Please, sir.
Don't leave me out here. Send me to prison. Just let me say goodbye. I'll give
you anything. I'll do anything. Please let me see her one more time.&quot;
Gerkowitcz stood back from the truck as if waiting for Clark to invite him back
in. Clark felt nothing for him. He was a scab on humanity, and in a matter of
hours, he'd be dead. Soon thereafter, he'd be consumed by insects and wildlife.
He'd be recycled, and that would be the greatest contribution the man would
ever give to the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You didn't give
me that chance. I couldn't say goodbye to my little girl. You sent her to the
desert to die. You threw her away like garbage. Now it's your turn to get
tossed you sick fuck!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took his foot off
the brake, then pressed hard into the gas. The rear wheels of the truck dug
into the desert, shot a trail of dust and gravel behind it as he sped off. As
he headed back the way he'd come in, he looked in his rear view mirror.
Gerkowitcz hadn't moved. He just stood there, bouncing on his feet, watching
the truck as it quickly faded from view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias sat in the
kitchen, Carol behind him rubbing his shoulders. His daughter and her husband
were there. His granddaughter,  Samantha, was running around with the family
dog, mercifully oblivious to the day's events. He'd buried Sanchez only hours
earlier, said goodbye to his partner, the young man he'd considered more of a
son than anything else. The service had been beautiful and brutal at the same
time. He'd walked to the podium, offered up some final thoughts on the kid, but
got too choked up to continue. He had to be escorted out by his wife, and now
here he was, drinking his fifth glass of wine, remembering Sanchez, wondering
what his own future held.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It certainly wasn't
with the force. He couldn't do that anymore. Not after what went down in the
desert. He'd killed a man. Not in cold blood, but in an act of passion. And
he'd covered it up, too. In fact, he'd fixed the whole crime scene. All around
Tiny, the big black man who'd gone in with Clark to help out. Tiny was just
about the right size, maybe a little too big. But Tobias had re-arranged
timelines, falsified reports, and massaged the data just enough to land the
responsibility for Hassenback's, Edurado's, and Chuck's deaths all on him. It
was all very elegant, but it was all very wrong just the same. And he was sure
if the case were ever re-opened, if it were scrutinized even a little bit, his
whole house of cards would come crashing down. And then he'd be asked to leave
the force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So he beat them to the
punch and resigned after he'd cleared all of his responsibilities from his
plate. His resignation didn't come out of guilt, though. It came from a
realization that the justice system, while tolerably efficient in most cases,
lacked the sharp edge it required to sever the slime from the rest of the
law-abiding citizens. It came from a realization that while Clark may not have
been right about what he did, he wasn't wrong either. He'd learned that,
sometimes, murder is righteous. As he continued thinking about his new
perception, his corrected understanding of the world he walked in daily, he
faintly heard the sound of Carol's voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I love you,
sweetie.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias reached over his
shoulder, held onto her hand with one if his. It felt warm, comfortable. It
felt like home. He laced his fingers in hers, but said nothing, just stared
into his wine glass. He was somehow struck with the burgundy color of the
liquid it contained. He found it beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We can make it,
you know. You can retire right now if you want to,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias shook himself
out of the wine glass, withdrew his hands, rubbed his eyes, then took another
sip of wine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm thinking
about hanging my own shingle, maybe part time. What do you think of that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol walked around the
table, sat in the chair across from him. &quot;I think that's a great idea,
honey. Whatever you want to do, you know I'm going to support it.&quot; She
patted his hand, then got up and gave him a kiss on the cheek. &quot;I'm going
to go check on Sam. Let me know if you need anything, okay baby?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded, then
watched his wife walk away. As he took another sip of wine, his mind shifted to
Clark. He should have gotten his number. He could have called him, told him he
might not have to run so far after all. But it'd been a week, and for all he
knew, Clark was in Mexico or Canada by now, well on his way to a new life. At
least he hoped so. He banished Clark from his mind, then focused again on his
wine glass. It was half full. Or maybe half empty. It all depended on
perspective, and he figured his needed to change. He'd been dressed up in black
inside and out for about a week. It was time to switch colors, time to stop
dwelling on the past, start living in the present. He'd place the word <i>private</i>
before detective and start thinking about the future too. He drained the rest
of his wine, pushed back from the table, then made his way into the living room
to join the rest of his family.</p>
