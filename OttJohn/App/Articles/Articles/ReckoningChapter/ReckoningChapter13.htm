<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias surveyed his
surroundings as Sanchez parked the cruiser in front of 1452 Warren, the address
of a small, older stucco home. While the house itself was representative of
many lower-income units populating neighborhoods just south of Santa Ana, he'd
never seen one quite so flamboyant: the roof of the house was flat and rocked,
its perimeter trimmed by a dark blue fascia, which itself was decorated along
its length with painted religious iconography. The exterior walls were painted
bright yellow, the high-decibel color mercifully interrupted at regular
intervals with small, square windows set within the stucco. The yard was a
neatly-kept rock garden made from red and white gravel, arranged carefully to
form small crosses on the ground. Various large rocks in the shape of fish were
scattered about thoughtfully to give the yard a vertical quality to an
otherwise flat presentation. A thin concrete path meandered from the sidewalk
to the front door, its entire length impressed with scripture. Tobias looked at
Sanchez, noticed his jaw had dropped just a little from the sheer
incomprehension of the spectacle. Neither of them made any kind of comment on
what they saw, its sum effect stifling any kind of lucid conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You want to get me up
to speed before we go up there brandishing our shields like a couple of big
shots?" asked Tobias as he tucked his PDA into his right front pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez pulled out his
notepad, flipped it open, and turned a few pages to scan for the correct
content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"The neighborhood is
mostly Hispanic. The woman and her daughter, however, are Russian immigrants;
the mother's name is Jana and the daughter's is Natashia. The husband is
deceased. He was Hispanic, served in Desert Storm, KIA while on his second
tour. Natashia was only five when he died. Three years later, she had the
misfortune of meeting Hassenback. Long story short, she was a brave little
girl, reported the assault, and he was convicted of two counts of first degree
sexual contact with a child under the age of 11. At the time of the
molestation, Jana had a boyfriend. His name's Bernito Javier. With respect to a
possible match with our guy, he doesn't even come close: about five-ten and
hundred and sixty pounds, according to the report."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded, then
thought briefly about the conversation they'd had the day before. Sanchez was a
young, and sometimes young guys find it difficult to separate personal issues
from those that are job-related. The commonality of having lost a loved one to
the war in the Middle East had the potential to bias him enough to keep him
from conducting an objective interview, and Tobias couldn't allow that. But the
kid looked sharp and appeared to be all business. All the same, he figured it
wouldn't hurt to quiz him a little. Just in case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Any other kids in the
house?&quot; Tobias asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Unknown. At the time
of the attack, though, Natashia was eight and an only child."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Friends,
relatives?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The incident
report conveys the family was pretty much an island. No indication of friends
besides neighborhood acquaintances, and absolutely no family on Jana's side
present. As for Bernito, he was a transplant from the Midwest, fairly new to
the area, and, from what the report says, kept pretty much to himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Criminal
history?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nothing more than
traffic violations for either one of them, boss. They're clean as they come.
When the initial complaint was filed, Bernito was working in a Mexican
Restaurant in Pasadena, and Jana split time between school and a job at a
coffee house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias reached for the
door handle, paused, then turned to his partner. "Okay. You conduct the
interview on this one. I'll just observe and take some notes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sounds good to me,
boss."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So, tell me, what are
we after?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We're looking for
evidence of a very large, over-protective significant other with homicidal
tendencies and a deep-seeded dislike for older, tech-savvy detectives." He
answered, smiling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave Sanchez an
uncustomary scowl. "I'm glad to see you're focusing on what's important; now
can you be serious for a second?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez made a little
frown, obviously disappointed Tobias had not laughed at his joke. "Sorry, boss.
You're right. Probably should be a little more focused right now.&quot; He
paused briefly. &quot;We're looking for deception."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right." Tobias turned
and looked again at the rock yard. He'd have to apologize to Carol when he
returned home. What he'd said about her garden had come purely from frustration
over the phony investment ad he'd found on Hassenback's thumb drive. He
sometimes let things get to him, and if he didn't watch it, they'd impact his
personal relationships. And now he'd unleashed some of that damned tetchy
disposition on Sanchez. Some days are just better off spent in bed. He released
the handle and pressed back into the passenger seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry for
snapping, kid. Okay, fill me in on deception.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez relaxed but
carried a more workman-like expression. "We're looking for deception on the
part of the principal occupants of the residence within the context of
questions we ask about Hassenback. Our key indication for detecting deception
will come from body language. We'll look for mechanical, non-fluid body
motions, hand movements to the face and ears, eye casts to the upper right,
avoidance of eye contact, sweating, defensiveness, and posture."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good," replied Tobias.
"And how will you check your conclusion of deception against one of simple
stress?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Change the topic of
conversation a couple of times and gauge the response. If the person being
questioned is forthcoming, there should be no discernable change in body
language, no variation from our metric."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias smiled to
himself. The kid was sharp. When he wanted to be. And he was just about ready
for the next step. He hadn't told Sanchez, but he was planning to write him a
letter of recommendation for an open position for Detective I. To him, there
was no doubt the kid was ready. Maybe he'd even write it sooner rather than
later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
exited the unmarked and walked the thin concrete path that lead from the
sidewalk to the front door of the house.  As Sanchez removed his wallet and
readied his badge for display, Tobias gave the door three solid raps, the sound
of which barely overcame the roaring din of an adjacent window-mounted air
conditioner. After a brief wait, a slender woman answered the door. She had on
a short, white skirt and an old, purple tank top that appeared ready to plunge
off her shoulders at any moment. Her hair was blonde, her eyes were blue, and 
her flip-flops were yellow. Tobias figured her to be somewhere on the wrong
side of forty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes?" The accent was
heavy with a nasal inflection, the vowel elongated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Miss Jana
Milescovitz?" Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes. What is this
about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez presented his
badge. "Afternoon, ma'am. I'm Officer Sanchez and this is Detective Tobias.
We'd like to ask you some questions if you don't mind."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jana briefly glanced at
Tobias and then turned directly toward Sanchez. Her brows furrowed and her face
flushed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This is about him,
yes? What he do? Get out? Savage little girl again?" Her voice moved from a
quiet tone of disbelief to an agonizing rage. The raw, emotional response mixed
with the language perturbations of a non-native speaker made her reaction
almost unintelligible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No ma'am." Sanchez
played with the edge of his notebook, appeared to struggle with distancing
himself from the woman's emotional distress. "We're very sorry for the
disruption, Miss Milescovitz. I understand that bringing back those memories
are difficult for you. But Hassenback has dropped off the radar, and we're just
going through ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jana looked at Sanchez
quizzically. &quot;Please. What you mean radar?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh, sorry ma'am.
It's just a figure of speech. I should have used a different word. What I meant
to say is we haven't been able to locate Hassenback, so we're here to ensure
he's had no contact with former victims. Just a precaution, ma'am. We hope you
understand."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Da  yes. Sorry." As
looked at Sanchez, her large, blue eyes began to well with tears. One escaped,
streaked down her rounded Slavic face, leaving a single, blue streak as it did.
"He is disappear? He is loose?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez ignored the
question, scribbled a note in his binder, then continued. &quot;The chance of a
repeat offense on a former victim with respect to a predator like Mr.
Hassenback is very small, ma'am. We really don't think you have anything to
worry about. However, we feel it's necessary to do the leg work just to make
sure. Have you received anything from Mr. Hassenback or perhaps even seen him
around, Ma'am?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No! You not call
animal mister! He is ... how you say  dog shit!" Her lower lip quivered.
Tobias handed her a handkerchief so she could wipe her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She turned to Tobias,
said "<i>Spasiba</i>," then turned back to Sanchez. "He is sending nothing. He
was not come by. I would know. I watch street and houses. I have many camera.
If I see crime, I log in computer. I have site. Keep record."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So you haven't seen or
heard from Hassenback at all?" Asked  Sanchez, couching the question more as a
statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No." She replied,
beginning to relax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez made another
note, then asked, "At the time of the incident, Miss Milescovitz, you had a
boyfriend. Is he still around?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He move to Chicago. He
left two years. Move back to family there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So you're alone now, ma'am?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes. Is better. I
focus on Natashia. She is still have problem from attack sometimes. It is all I
do to work and take care of daughter."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry to hear
that, ma'am. Where do you work?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I work in city
library. I help with computers and network.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Ouch! I have no
idea what to do with those things. It'd probably take me a week just to learn
how to turn one on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Is easy. You come
to library. I show you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Maybe I'll take
you up on that. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;<i>Puzhalsta</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Does that mean
you're welcome?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes. <i>Spasiba</i>
is for please. <i>Puzhalsta </i>is more like no problem.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias watched Sanchez
look down at his notepad then take a deep breath. He was preparing himself for
a reaction to his next question, and Tobias figured he'd get a fairly hostile response.
But it was human nature and something the kid would have to expect under the
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Is your daughter in,
ma'am?" Sanchez asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jana's eyes opened
wide, the angry flush returning to her face. "No," she said in a shaky whisper.
"No. You cannot talk. She has enough trouble. I will not allow!" She trailed
off, eyes again filling with tears, voice cracking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's not our
intention, ma'am. We don't want to ask her any questions, but we'd like to see
she's okay. Can you do that for us?" Sanchez's voice lost its detachment
briefly, softness forming around his words, which seemed to re-assure Jana.<br>
"Sorry. Yes. I can do." Jana turned, called back into the house for
her daughter. After a moment, a beautiful girl of about fifteen appeared, sporting
long brown hair, large eyes like her mother's, but with a face that wasn't
entirely Slavic; rather, her features appeared to have incorporated the best
her mother and her father's heritage had to offer. She was striking. She
stopped tentatively by her mother's side, looked at the two strangers at the
door, and then looked up at her mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Who are these people,
mother?" She sounded like any other California kid, her language free of the
foreign constraints that made her mother's conversation a little hard to
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"These men knew your
papa," she said. "I wanted you should meet them." She tugged at her earlobe and
made a tentative gesture toward Tobias. "This man was captain of papa's squad."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias smiled, then
added to the harmless fiction. "He was a good man, sweetheart. I was proud to
have served with him. You have a lot to be proud of, too, having had a father
like him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thank you," She said
it brightly and honestly but with the lack of emotion that made it clear she
never had the opportunity to know her father. She let her gaze linger on Tobias
for a brief moment, then shifted her attention again to her mother. "I'm
working on a project with Suzy, mom. Can she come over tonight?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes." Jana said. She
smiled as she watched her daughter disappear back into the house. Then she
turned back to Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This is satisfactory?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes, Ma'am."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias grabbed Sanchez
by the shoulder, then interjected himself into the conversation."Ma'am," he
said, softly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes. Are we done?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes, ma'am. Just one
more thing about Hassenback." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What? Tell me please."
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You don't have to
worry about him anymore. We've been checking former victims to build a suspect
list in his murder. Sorry for the trouble and the false pretence, but under the
circumstances, it couldn't be helped." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was shock, then a
little anger, then a look on her face that could only be bitter satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good!" She spat out.
"Bastard should be dead after what he do to my Natashia. This is best news!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes ma'am!" Sanchez smiled,
making no attempt to hide his agreement. "We won't take any more of your time.
Thanks again for your cooperation." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As they turned to go,
Tobias stopped and turned back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You mind if I ask you
one more question, ma'am?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Not at all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You said you posted
info about neighborhood observations you make?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes. I post. I have
website." She moved her right hand in front of her, gesturing  to the street
from left to right. "This is not good place. We have prostitute, drug dealer,
suspicious person. I see, I post. I get picture, I post."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you do with
the information after it's posted?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There is police
substation nearby. I give them address. They look at post. They tell me I do
good job. I might even get position to set up same in other places." She added
the last with a prideful smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias returned the
smile, wondered briefly if it was just a lack of opportunity that kept her from
moving to a better neighborhood. She certainly seemed to have skills. "That's a
wonderful thing you're doing, ma'am. And congratulations on the possible job
opportunity. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at what you've
created. Could you give me the address to your site?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes. I have no domain
name yet. Just IP address. It is 209, 45, 137, 168."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took out his PDA
and began punching in the address. As he entered the last of the four numbers,
the digits shattered into his mind like a brick exploding into a plate glass
window. He quickly returned his PDA to his pocket, then looked at the woman in
front of him, a big smile stretched across his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thank you, Miss
Milescovitz. You have been <i>very</i> helpful!" He then turned to Sanchez and
said, "Let's go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark sat alone in
his weekly, a hazy cone of yellow light enveloping him like a bright, airy
blanket. Instead of staving off the cold, though, it held against a darkness
that surrounded him, that encroached on his space, threatening to blacken
everything around him and within him. He was sitting at the table, chewing on a
protein bar, drinking coffee, and reviewing a checklist he had long ago created
to help him prepare for engaging targets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Normally, he would
wait a few weeks to make personal contact, using the intervening time to
observe his subjects, understand their habits, their schedules, and their
social interactions. It was their social-physical characteristics that were
especially important to him, as their pairing implicated his strategy for
approaching them. For those who were primarily introverts, he'd always elected
for a home visit. Small or large, those falling under that category had never
been a problem and had always given him the information he'd asked of them.
He'd elected to employ the same strategy for small to medium-sized extroverts
as well. They were typically much less cooperative, but he found that
well-placed threats and a little bodily harm got them to talk every time. Those
who were large and extroverted, obnoxious really, were better suited for
abduction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd worked with
only one, in Atlanta. And he was a handful. He was big, probably just short of
300 pounds, and he was mouthy. But the outward disposition of a man, the way he
interacts with others, doesn't ultimately get in the way of acquiring
information from him. It all boils down to will. Most men aren't going to
engage in a fight over information, especially when it's apparent the
altercation is going to find one of the participants in the hospital. Or worse.
Rather, when facing bodily harm, most reasonable men are going to simply do
what is asked of them; and in Clark's experience, asking for information was a
request most men found reasonable enough. It was mostly a matter of picking a
place and a time that maximized the odds of accomplishing his goal. His chosen
place; his chosen time. And that had always been enough to demoralize his
targets to a point they'd give him the information he'd asked of them. He was
simply a hunter. They were his prey. And any well-prepared hunter has a supreme
advantage over prey that has no idea it is being stalked, notwithstanding its
size or intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Most of Clark's
checklist was simply categories of information he gathered while watching his
targets over the course of weeks: physical description, particulars of
transportation, place of employment, shopping habits, forms of entertainment,
sleep patterns, social bearing and relationships, and living arrangements.
Unfortunately, in Eduardo's case, there were many points he wouldn't be able to
consider with the thoroughness he was accustomed to. In fact, all of his
planning for this engagement would have to come from just a single observation.
Clark flipped through his notebook to catalog what he'd seen at the coffee
house, hoping the little bit of Eduardo he had observed would give him the edge
he needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At 6:30 in the
evening, he'd made his way to the Gypsy Den. As he suspected, the coffee shop
was basically empty when he arrived twenty minutes later. That had made Eduardo
easy to identify. At around 6:55 in the evening, he spotted a 1974 Chevy Vega
rumble down the street, spewing out a trilogy of sound as it did: low, throaty
roar of exhaust; bass vibration from an expensive stereo system rattling tinted
windows, the opacity of which was legally questionable; and the intervallic
rumble of a small-block V8 engine. Clark noted the car was lowered, decked out
in low-profile wheels, and painted a repugnant metallic orange. About a half a
minute after it parked, a small, Hispanic man of about 35 stepped out. Clark
estimated he could be no more than five foot six and 150 pounds. He sported a
shaggy ponytail stretched tightly back, which caused his thin visage to appear
even narrower than it actually was. He had closely-set eyes, a large nose, and
a face that bore the wounds of a teenage war with acne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At around 7 PM,
Eduardo entered the coffee shop; Clark watched him walk to the counter, order a
beverage, and take a seat at the front of the store next to a large plate glass
window near the door. During the first ten minutes, Eduardo split his time
between taking sips of his beverage and batting the container between his
hands.  During the next five minutes, he spent his time pacing the length of
the coffee shop with a nervous energy, the same energy exhibited by most people
who find themselves struggling with impatience while longing to be somewhere
else. After about 15 minutes of waiting, Eduardo took a final sip of his
beverage, meandered to the counter, and engaged the clerk in an animated
conversation that lasted about four  minutes. Clark was fairly certain most of
the conversation was filled with a short description of Hassenback and whether
the clerk had seen a man fitting that description in or around the store. Of
course, the clerk had not, so Eduardo exited the coffee house, and spent his
the next eight minutes waiting outside smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Once Eduardo
finished his smoke, he took one last look in the coffee shop, then looked up
and down the street, lingering his gaze on corners and entryways to other
shops. Seemingly satisfied Hasseback wasn't going to show, he returned to his
vehicle, started it up, and drove away. As he vibrated down the street, Clark
started his pickup, waited for two cars to fill the void between them, and
followed. Fifteen minutes later, he found himself on Parton Street, driving
into a collection of low-end apartment buildings. Clark watched as Eduardo
parked his car, then drove past and eased his truck into a space four stalls
away. He then adjusted his rear-view mirror, took out his pay-as-you-go cell
phone, and pantomimed a phone conversation as he watched Eduardo walk from his
car to a second story unit right in front of the complex. Clark held his
position for another hour to ensure Eduardo had indeed returned home for the
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he sat in front
of this computer, Clark thought about what he'd seen. Eduardo was definitely
small, but he was no shrinking violet. He had a loud car, and he had no trouble
at all engaging the clerk at the coffee shop in a conversation he had
initiated. Certainly, then, Eduardo should be classified as an extrovert. He
played some scenarios out in his mind and decided a home visit would be the
best strategy. Given Eduardo's spare stature, any kind of struggle would be a
non-issue. Further, his extroverted nature could be easily subdued with an
early morning visit, when he was asleep and most vulnerable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark leaned back
in his chair and thought about his objective. Initially, it had been to simply
gather enough information from Eduardo to determine the location of the facility
his daughter had been taken to. After some thought, however, he decided he
should probably leave nothing to chance, conduct the interview in exactly the
same way he had all of the others, and gather every bit of useful information
he could. It seemed to be the most prudent route to take. After all, what if
for some reason he was not able get the location of the facility from him? What
if the facility had drivers that were sent to pick up its patrons, conveying
them in the darkened back of a windowless van? Better to conduct a solid
interview to keep his investigative continuity strong. If Eduardo came through
and gave him the location, great; if he could not, then Clark would at least
have some information to work with to build more leads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Satisfied he had
all the information he was realistically going to collect about Eduardo, Clark
closed his laptop, went to his bed, and opened the bags of supplies he had
bought on his return trip to the weekly. He'd patronized four different
businesses to purchase what he required for his interview: a hardware store to
pick up duct-tape, cotton gloves, a three-pack of painting masks, two gallons
of white flat paint, and a rolling kit; a medical supply outfit to pick up
disposable paper outerwear and booties; a used clothing store to pick up a pair
of slacks, a white shirt, a blue tie, a worn brown jacket, and pair of leather
boots; and a toy store to pick up a metal police badge, a realistic-looking
pair of plastic handcuffs, a cowboy hat that might fit a nine year old boy, a
toy gun, and a supply of caps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Of course, the
paint, rollers, hat, gun, and caps were not anything Clark planned to employ in
his interrogation. Rather, they were simply diversions. Going into a hardware
store and buying duct tape, gloves, and a mask might look a little suspicious;
buying paint and a roller kit as well made the purchase look altogether
ordinary. The same could be said about the badge and handcuffs. Without the gun
and caps and hat, the purchase might look somewhat incongruous, adding to the
purchase lowered the risk for suspicion. Certainly, the additional purchases
were a waste of money, and throwing the supplies into an anonymous dumpster on
his way home only added to the squander, but a little lost cash was much more
preferable than grabbing the attention of a paranoid store clerk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark moved the
bags of supplies from the bed to the floor, turned off the lonely incandescent
bulb that hung above the table, and crawled into bed, his only remaining
preparation to ensure his body was reasonably well-rested. In two and a half
hours, he would drive to Eduardo's and present himself as a detective. It would
be three in the morning, and more than likely, Eduardo wouldn't have any idea
what hit him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Windows rolled
down, Dean Gerkowitcz breathed in the morning desert air as he drove the last
leg of his journey toward his property. It was located just off the Mojave
Highway, at about the midway point between Vegas and L.A., deep in the desert
and literally in the middle of nowhere. The closest establishment was an old
mining facility on Halloran Summit Road, which was located about 170 miles from
the front door of his home in L.A. The drive itself should have taken about
three hours, but he liked to cover the distance a little more slowly. In his
fast-paced, work-a-day world, an easy drive into the unforgiving, desolate
landscape of the southwest was just what the doctor ordered. The desert air
seemed to clear his mind, purge the debris that collected there as a result of
his investment work in the city; the drive itself allowed him to switch mental
gears and concentrate on the goals he'd laid out for the next phase of his new
venture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He exited Highway
15 and turned left on Halloran Summit road, which he followed for a good
quarter mile until it terminated at a county dirt road. The road was composed
of an unforgiving mixture of moderate grades, small rocks, and a lot of sand,
so he flipped his SUV into four-wheel drive and followed it as it meandered
through a forest of cactus, Yucca, and Joshua trees. As he drove the last half
mile to his turn, he marveled once more at the immensity of the property he
owned. It was over 1500 acres, stretching from the center of the dirt road on
which he was now driving to just over the ridge of the hill to the southwest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He took a left
onto his access road, then breathed a sigh of relief as the suspension on his
BMW stopped squeaking. Compared to the last three and a half miles of dirt he'd
just driven, his driveway felt more like the autobahn. Topped with a solid
surface of crushed gravel, it stretched about a quarter mile to a circular
parking area that fronted his buildings, all of which were situated at the base
of the hill behind his property. The length of the road itself was not an
accurate indication of the true distance from the buildings on the land,
though. In fact, it had two very exaggerated switchbacks that served to
disorient uninvited guests who happened to chance their way onto the property,
something a straight driveway of a few hundred feet simply couldn't do. Either
side of the driveway was lined with cottonwood trees, a staple of desert
farmland. They were thick, purposefully unkempt, with lots of low-lying
branches, and planted close enough together to form an almost uninterrupted
wall of vegetation along the entire length of the road. The overall effect of
the wall was to efficiently obscure the buildings behind them while offering a
striking contrast to the native foliage surrounding the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz pulled
into the looping driveway and parked, the crackling of the  gravel under his
tires giving way to a peaceful silence that might sound strange and perhaps
even a little unnerving to someone who'd spent his whole life in the city. He
got out of his car and looked around. The property came with three buildings: a
main house, a large, red wooden barn, and a guest house. The main house was
roughly 5500 square feet and decked out in a rustic opulence that would rival
many of the newer homes parked the hills above Hollywood. The barn housed a
couple of working horses that were used  by a small crew of part-time ranch
hands he employed to tend to the chores in and around the property, which
included keeping the 15 head of cattle he owned fed, watered, and out of
trouble. The barn came complete with a hay loft and two water troughs, both of
which were fed with their own direct line to an underground aquifer. As for the
guest house, Gerkowitcz took that for himself when he visited, as the main
building was used for another purpose directly related to his business. The
guest house was a newer, wooden structure probably built in the late 90's. It
was about 2400 square feet, which was small by his standards. But with three
bedrooms, two baths, walk-in closets, a living room with a large screen TV, and
a gourmet kitchen, it suited his needs adequately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd first looked
into purchasing the property five years back. When he'd been caught up in all
the paranoia about the end of civilization due to political instability, the
financial crisis, the healthcare crisis, the technological dehydration of the
American workforce, the wars in the Middle East, and the health of the planet
in general. From where he stood, the whole world was going to Hell in a hand
basket, America in particular. At the time, he'd read voraciously about the
shifting of global power, the dumbing down of American children, and the impact
that was going to have in the near future: innovation had been responsible for
keeping America ahead of the rest of the world for the last two centuries.
After so many years of leading in every conceivable category, from science to
agriculture to military might, he watched as Americans sat on their collective
dead asses and allowed the rest of the world to catch up. He figured in another
fifty years there wouldn't even be an America anymore, not as he knew it
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was especially
worried American affluence was coming to a quick end, the death throes of which
would present a sickening land and asset grab by minorities, mostly Mexicans,
Chinamen, Japs, and towel heads, none of whom did anything to help make this
country great. Just a bunch of fucking vultures hastening the death of a great
nation so they could feed on its rotting carcass. And he didn't want to be anywhere
near a metro area when the hammer fell. He'd convinced himself he needed a
shelter from the shit storm that was coming. A place he could take his family
and wait out the inevitable invasion of America's infrastructure by the very
parasites it had worked so hard to sustain during the past century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What he needed was
a fortress, a place so far out of the way no one would ever want to take the
time to bother him. When he first found the property, it was listed as a
severely-reduced, somewhat distressed ranch off from highway 15. He'd been
looking for a place for about a year then. Having found nothing worth a damn,
he decided to take a drive out to the desert to check it out. When he arrived,
he was skeptical. The guest house was in great shape, but the main building
needed a lot of work: the wiring needed to be upgraded from what was considered
state-of-the-art in the 1930's, the interior walls were old and damaged, the
roof needed to be replaced, the flooring was rotting, and the windows were
cracked, some broken. And that was the good news. The real downside, in his
opinion, was that the place was in the middle of nowhere, the roads that lead
to it were an unmaintained disaster, and most of the land itself looked so dry
he may as well have been on the fucking moon. The listing, too, was right at
seven million. He figured the place needed at least a half a million in
building rehabilitation and another quarter million in upgrades, and that was
just about enough to make him want to drive away and not look back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he was about to
decline any further consideration toward purchasing the property, the realtor,
a fairly nice-looking buxom blonde who broadcasted a slightly slutty cowgirl
look, had insisted in a rather touchy-feely way he first listen to what came with
it. As she itemized the features for him, three things stood out: one, the top
of the hill behind the property was populated with six windmills, which powered
the entire facility in addition to making about a thousand a month from the
sale of surplus energy to the local power company; two, the land came with
water and mineral rights. The wells on the property were sound and certified to
last at least another hundred years; and three, the northwest part of the land
contained a spring-fed pond the previous owner had stocked with trout. Not that
bottom-feeding carp bull crap you couldn't feed to a hungry pig, but the kind
of fish fit for human consumption. The bottom line of the whole delivery was
that the entire place was off the grid and self-sustainable for many years if
managed properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When she'd
finished, his interest had been rekindled, not enough to run out and buy the
place right away, but he could definitely feel his evangelical survivalist
spirit soaring, just about high enough to touch the goddamned face of Jesus H.
Christ himself. He'd swallowed the information from the realtor like a
dehydrated, half-dead man crawling through a hot desert would take to a canteen
full of ice-cold water. The business-savvy side of him, though, still had
considerable trouble with the seven million dollar price tag. That and the
extra million in upgrades put the total cost just outside of his budget. He'd
been interested enough, though,  to return to the property five times, each
visit resulting in the two sides of his personality waging war: the survivalist
in him declaring the roads, in their terrible state of disrepair, added a
measure of defensibility; the business-savvy side of him arguing the property
was over-valued and that only a fool would buy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the end, during
his fifth visit, he'd asked the realtor to leave him with the property alone
overnight. He figured he shouldn't have her around. Instead of concentrating on
the property, which was what he should've been doing all along, he'd been
enjoying the guest house and partaking in the carnal pleasures of what he'd
come to think of as a sexy and accomplished professional woman, certainly a
hell of a lot more sexy and accomplished than the pathetic, good-for-nothing
sorry excuse for a woman taking up space and air at his house in L.A. There was
another reason he didn't want the realtor lady to stay with him, too: he had it
in his mind he wasn't going to put an offer in, and he didn't want to have to
say goodbye to her. He just wanted to have one last night of peace and quiet in
the desert, drink a little beer, watch a little television, and then leave the
next morning, never to return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rather than watch
television and relax, though, he spent a good chunk of the evening walking
around the grounds. He returned to the main building and looked at the
valuations of the house over the years. The numbers didn't add up. The previous
owner, who'd died several years earlier, obviously had the same survivalist
bug: he'd put in the windmills, upgrading them even, and carved out a  pond and
stocked it with trout. He wanted the entire property off the grid, and he'd
succeeded. For the life of him, though, Gerkowitcz couldn't understand how the
property had laddered up to 25 million in 2007. Certainly, all of California
was in the midst of an orgy of unmerited real-estate appreciation, but in his
best judgment he couldn't see it being valued at any more than 15-17 million at
even its most obscene markup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After a few hours
of reviewing the documents, he'd finally had enough. He filed the papers in the
main building's large kitchen, grabbed his beer from the dining room table, and
started toward the rear door. As he reached for the handle, he remembered he'd
overlooked the basement. Curious, he took a swig of his beer, opened the door
to the basement, flipped on the light to illuminate his way down its narrow
staircase, and descended. When he got to the bottom, what he saw looked more
like a hollowed-out rock than a basement, sort of like a man-made cave. Besides
the open space and debris scattered about, mostly appliances and tools from an
age long gone by, there was nothing. He walked across the floor to the far end
of the basement and touched the damp, rock wall. As he moved about, he noticed
his footfalls hollowed out somewhat. The effect was minor, and would completely
escape detection unless considerable attention was given to the sound. He
walked over the area several more times, listening closely, leaning into the
floor and testing it for weakness and pliability. After several minutes, he was
convinced the floor below the corner of the basement was hollow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He kneeled on the
floor and used his hands to scrape the loose dirt from around the spot. After
digging a hole about four inches deep, he reached a square slab of plywood, which
he figured to be about five feet on a side. The plywood was nestled snugly into
a concrete lip, the seam too tight to allow him to use his fingers to pry it
up. Remembering the tools he saw on the far wall, he stood and walked to the
other side of the basement. After a minute of searching, he found what he was
looking for: an old, standard screwdriver with a long shaft and a head thin
enough to fit between the plywood and the concrete. He returned to the hole,
knelt in the dirt, and worked to lever the plywood out of the lip. After a few
minutes, his effort was rewarded. He held the screwdriver in place, put his
hand beneath the exposed edge of wood, lifted the sheet up, and flipped it over
to the side. What he found under the plywood took his breath away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz shook
off his reminisce, stepped out of his Beamer, and took a big gulp of desert
air. Everything he'd suspected during that final visit had been right on the
money. What he found in the basement of the main building that evening had
overwhelmingly changed his mind about purchasing the property. What he'd found,
too, had more than made up for the obscene discrepancy in its valuation. Upon
walking back up the steps of the basement that night, he knew he had to buy the
property. He also knew what he had to use it for.</p>
