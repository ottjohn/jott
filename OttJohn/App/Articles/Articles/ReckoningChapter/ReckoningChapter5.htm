<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri Parker
angled her green Prius into a spot in front of the Rusty Pelican, a bar and
grill at which she'd agreed to meet a girlfriend for drinks and appetizers. She
exited her car, walked across the sidewalk and toward the front of the
establishment, which presented tall, smoky glass windows just opaque enough to
allow pedestrians a foggy glimpse into its cavernous interior. She'd never been
to the bar before, had never been into the bar-hopping scene, but as she
entered through one of its big, glass doors, she immediately felt a sense of
kinship with the place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The establishment
had a comfortable-looking dining area to the right and a full-service lounge to
the left. And it was all done up a nautical theme: rustic-looking, with lots of
wood, nets, and whaling artifacts placed tastefully throughout to pay homage to
a profession that had seen its heyday more than a century before. Cutting the
interior space into two equal parts from rear to front was an enormous bar,
impressively shaped like a 19th century whaler, and carefully engineered to
appear as if it were erupting from the oaken floor beneath it. The ship had
three large masts, each erected from translucent shelving packed full of rum,
vodka, and tequila bottles. The shelves were constructed to wrap around
floor-mounted spotlights, which cast powerful beams up and through the glassy
masts to give them the glowing look of St. Elmo's fire. The bar was anchored in
an upscale neighborhood of Pasadena, a community close enough to L.A. to afford
its residents the conveniences of big city life, but far enough away to escape
the ubiquity of the crime and excess that infected the greater metropolitan
area. Carri walked across the hardwood floor and took a seat at one of the
round tables on the port side of the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Besides the staff,
the bar was peppered here and there with patrons, a testament to the financial
difficulties that had again descended onto the state of California. Typically,
during economic downturns, tributary communities around the Basin remained
fairly insulated from the cyclic financial distresses that hit L.A. This time,
the financial mess had rippled violently from the city center, spreading its
concentric rings of financial hardship outward until they lapped at the shore
of the normally bustling bar. It was still early, though, just a little after 7
PM, and the crowds would surely gather over the next two hours. A tiny waitress
in wench's attire approached with a smile, thankful for something to do. Carri
looked over the wine list, ordered a glass of Pinot Noir, and waited for her
friend Lisa to arrive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She'd met Lisa
while doing a story for the <i>LA</i> <i>Times</i> about the quality of
healthcare for seniors in L.A. hospitals. A friend of a friend had mentioned
Lisa as a young but very capable nurse who might be interested in helping with
the story. She'd been told that while Lisa worked with pre-adolescent children,
she had formerly specialized in senior care. Upon meeting, she'd found Lisa to
be a fiery advocate for seniors, pointing out a multitude of hardships that
confronted them every day in California's monolithic healthcare system. Along
the way, Lisa had taken great pains to help Carri understand the
senior-relevant medical landscape and the sometimes-complicated information she
received from local experts. By the time she'd completed her article, she'd
found much more than a competent source in Lisa, she'd found a life-long
friend. After weeks of collecting data and collaborating with her new friend,
she finally had her article. It had merited front page placement and was
received very well by both local and national readers, even garnering her some
regional awards. Emboldened by success, Carri had pitched her editor a similar
story on children. He liked the idea, so here she sat, sipping her wine,
waiting to ask her friend if she would once again guide her through
California's persistently over-complicated healthcare system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As ten minutes of
waiting slipped to twenty, Carri ordered another glass of pinot, then glanced
toward the aft part of the bar where a television was hanging from the ceiling.
As she watched the latest news on CNN, she caught herself looking occasionally
at a man sitting by himself at the stern of the ship. He was large, probably
over six feet, definitely over 200 pounds. He had light brown, cropped hair,
which she thought might place him in the military. He had a generally
rough-hewn but handsome face that looked as though he'd not shaved in the last
day or so. He leaned over the bar, large hands cradling a beer. He looked directly
forward, seemingly at nothing. His eyes appeared focused, steely, and intense.
She could imagine his fixed stare boring holes through the rear of the ship,
drilling right through the forecastle and out the front of the bar. Whoever he
was, he looked as though he had a lot on his mind. She tried to look away, but
found it difficult, the same way people find it hard to avert their attention
from an accident. She considered herself a student of society and believed she
had a knack for first impressions, and if her first impression about the man at
the end of the bar was correct, he wasn't just a traffic accident, he was a
train wreck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri's natural
instinct for finding a story was suddenly supplanted by shame for staring at
the man. She tried again to look away, succeeded for a time, but her gaze
gravitated back toward him. She was curious about what kind of thoughts, if
any, were ruminating behind those eyes. He raised the bottle to his mouth, its
neck pinched between his fore- and middle fingers. The movement distressed the
sleeves on his shirt, which were momentarily punched skyward by a bicep muscle
as he downed the rest of his beer. He set the empty on the bar, then glanced in
her general direction. They'd shared eye contact for just a split second, but
that was enough to send an ice-cold shiver up and down her spine. Whatever he
was thinking, it was too hot for her. She looked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What the hell are
you looking at?" A voice asked from behind her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri stiffened
but didn't turn. She didn't need to. The voice belonged to her ex-husband, a
first-rate ass whom she'd divorced two years ago. Since she'd left him, he'd
disrupted her life constantly, which had caused her to contemplate everyday how
she would drive to work, where she could go to lunch, how she would get home,
where she could meet with friends, and even where she could go shopping. She'd
done everything she could to keep him away, even calling the police and going
through the court system to file a restraining order. As a last resort, she'd
even moved and kept her location a secret from everyone except her closest
friends. Her career, it seemed, had been work and avoiding Chuck, the maelstrom
in her life that had suddenly appeared on the shores of this sparsely populated
island in the middle of Pasadena. Obviously, Chuck wanted Carri, but what Carri
wanted was irrelevant. She remained motionless just long enough to build up her
resolve, then slowly turned to face him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why are you
here?" She asked, flustered. Carri was genuinely scared of the man. And she had
reason to be. He'd put her in the hospital more than once, and he'd scared the
living hell out of her more times than she cared to remember. When they'd first
met, she knew he'd be a little difficult; but at the time, he was mostly sweet,
even romantic. His gentle side, however, was balanced with a nasty disposition,
which was exacerbated by an addiction to alcohol. She had thought she could
change him, calm the dark beasts that occasionally made him crazy. But she had
no idea what she was getting into, no idea of the possessive, jealous, and
abusive monster he could be. As time passed, his addiction worsened, and with
the alcohol came the abuse, both mental and physical. And now he was here, and
she had no idea how this was going to end. From the look on his face, probably
in the emergency room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Don't ask me any
fucking questions! I asked you what the fuck you're looking at!" He grabbed her
arm, his ruddy face flushed red with a happy rage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She unsuccessfully
tried to free herself from his grip.. At six foot and a little over 200 pounds,
Chuck was just too much for her petite frame. She looked him in the eyes,
praying he wouldn't get any more violent. She could smell the alcohol on his
breath, escaping every pore of his body in a repugnant, bitter stink that made
her want to throw up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm not looking
at anyone, Chuck! Please let go of me. You're hurting me!" Carri was on the
verge of tears, her voice cracked, elevated to just under a shout. The staff
and the patrons had now taken notice, each of them lingering at that uncertain
point between acknowledgement and action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Fuck you!" He
replied. Then more softly, "Look, we need to talk. Let's go to the car. I
promise I won't hurt you. Let's just get out of here, okay baby?" Chuck
tightened his beefy grip around Carri's wrist, began pulling her off her seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No! Stop it!
You're hurting me! Stop, Chuck!" This time, she did shout. Feeling trapped and
in imminent danger, she began fighting back by kicking, pulling, and
scratching. Whatever the outcome, she knew she had to resist Chuck with every
ounce of strength she had. She knew if he took her now, forced her out of here,
the only thing waiting for her would be a savage beating and another week in
the hospital, at best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By now, the entire
bar was transfixed with the drama. The bartender, a young kid, probably a
college student, tentatively approached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey! Sorry, but
the two of you'll hafta leave. If you don't, I'll be forced to call the cops."
He then made a nervous show of reaching for and picking up the receiver. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Instead of scaring
some sense into him, the threat from the bartender only enraged Chuck further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look what you
did, bitch!" He screamed as he pulled Carri violently from where she was
sitting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri made one
last attempt to pull herself free, but Chuck was too strong. She had tried to
use the floor as leverage, but all she'd managed to do was hurt her wrist more
and slip and fall against her chair. Chuck looked down at her menacingly, his
sandy blonde hair now dripping a little with sweat, his eyes crazy with rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Get up, and get
your ass into the car. Now!" He spoke it almost in a whisper, a
carefully-controlled voice that told her if she didn't comply, she'd be beaten.
It was that eye-of-the-storm voice he had just before he flipped out. Carri
wanted nothing to do with it, decided she'd make a stand. She'd fight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No!" She sobbed,
defiantly. She remained on the floor, crying. The bartender began punching
digits on the phone. Then an unfamiliar voice interjected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Listen, Chuck, I
don't think the girl wants to go home with you, so why don't you just take this
opportunity to get out of here before someone gets hurt?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri looked up.
Behind Chuck stood the man with the cold, steel blue eyes. The man who'd been
sitting at the end of the bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;
line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark had watched
the drama unfold along with the other patrons in the bar. He didn't want to get
involved, didn't want to risk putting himself on anyone's radar unless he
really had to. But no one else reacted. They were all immobilized, looking like
shocked bystanders, uncertain how to quench the domestic violence burning in
front of them. They all simply remained seated, watching. Even the bartender
seemed to have trouble making his fingers work the keypad of the bar phone. So
Clark watched with them, hoping someone would step up. Then the guy named Chuck
pulled the woman from her chair, and that's when he'd decided he'd seen enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He stepped off his
stool, walked around behind the guy, and offered up his warning. But the man
didn't turn around, didn't acknowledge him. Maybe he'd gotten the name wrong,
or maybe the guy was just so focused on beating the woman, he hadn't heard.
Just as he was about to repeat his warning, the man turned to face him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck's face was
flushed red, his eyes wide like saucers. He took a step forward, then pushed
his face into Clark's space, just close enough so their noses were no more than
three inches apart. Then he threw his arms out to the sides, cocked his head to
the left a little, and said, &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark could smell
the alcohol. And that was good and bad news: the bad news was Chuck was going
to fight someone. The alcohol made that unavoidable. The good news was Chuck
was going to be easy to take down. The alcohol made that unavoidable too. Clark
recaptured his personal space by taking a step back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just a guy
who isn't going to let a jackass like you continue to hurt the lady.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Jackass?&quot;
Chuck paused, looked at Clark as if he were sizing him up. &quot;If you know
what's good for you big guy, you'll back the fuck off. Me and my girl are
having a little disagreement. But it's over now. We're going home. You get in
my way, you're gonna regret it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he listened to
Chuck's slurred threat, Clark noticed the woman had successfully wrung herself
free. But she remained on the floor, looking terrified as she massaged her left
wrist with her right hand. Then Chuck turned back toward her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You fucking
bitch!" He seethed. "Get your ass up and let's get the fuck out of here." He
bent closer, said in a whisper, "Get up. I swear to God I'll kill you if you
don't do what I say!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Chuck started
moving toward the woman, Clark grabbed his right elbow and spun him around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look, you're not
listening to me, sport. The woman doesn't want anything to do with you. Don't
make a scene. Just go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And what if I
don't, asshole?" Chuck took a step forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark waited as
the woman seized the opportunity to move away to safety behind the bar, then he
shifted his stance slightly so his body angled away from Chuck's. First rule of
fighting: never let your opponent get an easy shot at your package.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, pal," Clark
said coolly, "your choice. You can leave now on your feet, or you can stick
around and wind up having a couple of EMT's carry you out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"How's that, big
man? You gonna fuck me up?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck moved a
little closer, reclaimed the personal space Clark had freed up by taking the
step back. The man's hairline was beginning to drip with sweat, his words had
gone up in pitch, leveled off somewhere between a command and a scream. Clark
kept his eyes on Chuck's,  then took a half step back to regain the real
estate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's the
general idea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right!" Chuck
screamed as he launched a lumbering haymaker with his left hand, targeting
Clark's right temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark pulled back,
causing Chuck's fist to miss wildly. The momentum behind the swing caused the
man to stumble to the left slightly, so Clark shifted to the left along with
him, just far enough to grab his collar and pull him in for a vicious head butt
to the nose. He could hear the crunching disintegration of cartilage as the
crown of his forehead slammed into the man's face. Chuck's head careened
backward from the impact, his legs buckled, and a crimson geyser followed him
downward as he crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark moved around
Chuck so the man's nose was facing away from him. Then he knelt and pressed a
knee between Chuck's neck and jaw, applying just enough pressure to cut a
little circulation and a little air. As a small pool of blood spread on the
floor beneath Chuck's face, Clark bent over so his mouth was just over the
man's left ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Listen, Chuck,
I'm gonna give you a really important piece of advice right now, and if you're
smart, you'll listen."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck moaned lightly,
managed to gurgle out, "You broke my fucking nose!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark pressed a
little harder with his knee, pushing Chuck's face into the oaken floor. "You
have to concentrate, Chuck, okay? I need you to pay attention to this. You
gonna listen?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah." Chuck gasped,
taking a ragged breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"The woman you're
harassing, what's her name?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Carri." He
retched as he wheezed the name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Given the angle of
Chuck's head, Clark figured blood was starting to pool at the back of his nose
and beginning to flow down his esophagus. He'd have to let him up soon, or he'd
choke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Listen, Chuck,
Carri doesn't like you. Quite frankly, neither do I. You're an asshole. You
listening?" Clark slapped the side of Chuck's face a couple of times until he
got a reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah." Chuck gasped,
coughing up a little blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, Chuck,
Carri's my new friend, and I'm very protective. That means you have to be
careful …"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Fuck you!" The
words were coughed out explosively, rather than spoken. Little trails of blood
streamed in front of Chuck, painting the picture of a  crimson crown on the
floor in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Chuck." Clark
admonished. "You're not listening." Clark pressed his knee down a little
harder, until Chuck's face turned beet red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Listen carefully.
I'm very protective of my friends. They're like family to me. If I hear you
even so much as give Carri a questionable look, I'll hunt you down. And here's
the important part, okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;When I find
you, Chuck, you won't be walking away after I'm done with you. Is that
clear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck managed to
grunt out an acknowledgement, the lack of any verbal concession signifying he
was having difficulty breathing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, sport. I
guess you can go. Do me a favor and just get out. Don't look back." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark pushed
himself off the floor, then walked around Chuck to place his body in a
defensive position in front of Carri, who was still behind the bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck stumbled to
his feet, tripped to the nearest table, grabbed some napkins to stanch the
blood pouring from his nose. He then turned toward Clark, looked as if he were
going to say something, but instead turned and headed for the door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The bar was silent
as Clark watched Chuck leave. He didn't know if the bartender had finally
gotten around to calling the police, but he figured he'd play it safe and
assume the kid did. He waited a minute longer to ensure Chuck wouldn't return,
then turned to Carri and nodded as he headed for the exit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri just stood
there, so stunned she hadn't noticed Lisa had entered the bar, was standing
right next to her, just as terrified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh my God, Carri!
Are you okay? That was Chuck, wasn't it? Who the hell was the other guy?" Lisa
asked the questions frantically, her words shaken with stress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri didn't
answer, just walked slowly toward the door, taking her tentative first steps to
run after the man who'd saved her from a trip the emergency room. She wasn't
sure that going after him was a good idea. But she wasn't sure about a lot of
things lately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where're you
going?" Lisa placed a hand on Carri's forearm, causing her to slow but not stop
entirely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I need to thank
him." She motioned toward the door as she continued to walk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Are you sure
that's such a good idea? Maybe he's just a drunk who was looking for a fight.
Maybe he's no better than Chuck himself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"All the same,
Lisa, he may have just saved my life. The least I can give him is a thank you."
She stopped, then looked at her friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, I think I
want to do this alone. It's going to be awkward enough. Can you wait for me at
the bar and order me another drink? I'll be back in a minute."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, honey. You sure
you're okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah," she lied. How
could she be okay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Lisa headed back to
the bar, Carri walked quickly to the door, hoping she wasn't too late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;
line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark walked
toward his truck like a guy in a bit of a rush, but not so much of one as to
attract attention. What the hell was he thinking? Stupidity, the essential
ingredient for disaster. And he just whipped up one of the dumbest meals he'd
cooked up for himself in a long time. A fight in a bar days after he'd killed a
guy just across town wasn't asking for trouble; it was begging for it. He
retrieved his keys from his pocket and unlocked his truck, an old 1996 F150. He
was about to open the door of his pickup when he heard the <i>clack-clack</i>
of heals closing in behind him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wait!" Female
voice. The woman from the bar. Carri.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark backed away
from his truck, then turned toward the sidewalk and crossed in front of a
tattoo parlor, moving as if he didn't hear her. He slowed up his pace a little,
studied a sign on the parlor door advertising its operating hours. He saw no
point in evasion, he'd have to come around to his truck later anyway, and that
would cost him precious time. He didn't want to talk to the woman, either, but
perhaps if he ignored her, she'd get the idea and get the hell home before
Check decided to return. No sirens yet, maybe he could still make it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wait!" Carri
exclaimed again. "Please stop!&quot; She knew he was ignoring her, but she'd
noticed he'd slowed. She continued until she was about ten feet from him, then
remembered what Lisa had said. She had no idea who this guy was, but she didn't
believe he was there hoping for a fight. It didn't make sense. He looked like a
guy with enough troubles already, not like one who needed more. Still, she
couldn't be too careful. She already had one violent stalker; she didn't need
another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As the man turned
to face her, she was again taken by his cold, steel blue eyes. She tried to
look down, away from them, but she was frozen. Again she began to wonder what
thoughts ruminated behind them, what scars had chilled them, froze them to
their core. There was deep anger in them. And hurt. Instinctively, she stepped
back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man shrugged,
turned, and started walking away. Not the reaction she was looking for. Not the
interaction she had in mind. Not a good day at all. She cast her eyes to the
dirty sidewalk, studied the discarded cigarette butts cast about by careless
smokers, then burst into tears. It was all just a little too much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She'd spent the
last few years hiding and running from Chuck, a man who clearly deserved every
ounce of scorn she could throw his way. And now for some ridiculous reason, she
felt slighted by this man who had just stepped in and helped her out in a big
way. She felt her face flush, her hands begin to tremble. A feeling of vertigo
took hold of her. She leaned on the cement wall of the tattoo parlor behind
her, became vaguely aware of her tears. She covered her eyes with her hands and
tried as best she could to choke back the sobs, then slowly started sinking to
the grimy sidewalk. To hell with her clothes. To hell with what people thought.
To hell with men. To hell with it all. Just as she was about to settle onto the
concrete, she was suddenly propped up by a pair of very strong hands. She
panicked, thinking Chuck had stuck around, returning to finish what he'd begun.
But the panic was short-lived, replaced almost instantly by a maniacal anger,
rooted in years of pent up resentment for having to live the way she did. She
used every bit of energy to free her elbows, then screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Get the fuck
away, Chuck!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She waited for the
beating. But it didn't come. She looked up, found herself staring into those
steel blue eyes again. And they were no longer cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark knew he had
to get away, but he didn't feel right about leaving Carri on the sidewalk,
alone, and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Maybe he had a little time. He
still hadn't heard any sirens. He wondered if the bartender had even called the
police, began to doubt that he had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Are you going to
be okay?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri retreated a
step, then looked up. "Sorry. I thought you were Chuck.&quot; She paused,
shifting big blue eyes nervously to the left and right. &quot;Yeah. I think so.
Just tired of the hassle; tired of running and hiding.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Does he know
where you live?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, I don't think
he does. I've been careful."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You here alone?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No. I have a
friend inside. I was supposed to meet her about an article I'm writing for the
paper."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why isn't this
guy in Jail, Carri?" She perked up a little when he said her name. Clark didn't
understand why, but it was a good sign. Perhaps she'd recover quickly enough,
and he could get back to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He did go to
jail after his last assault. Since then, he's been a lot more careful, mostly
just following me around, sending me nasty emails, damaging my property, that
sort of thing. He's gotten really good at it too. Most of what he does I can't
prove, so the cops don't seem too interested.&quot; She paused. &quot;Listen,
I'm really sorry you had to get involved. Thank you very much just the same. I
know you're busy, so I'll let you go. Thanks for listening, ..." Carri paused
again, waiting for the man in front of her to fill in the blank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Joe. It was
my pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri smiled
weakly, then turned and headed back to the Pelican. As he watched her walk
away, Clark figured he could do one more thing for her, something to keep her
safe and get them both on their way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Carri,&quot; he
called after her, taking a couple of steps her way as he did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She turned to face
him. For the first time he became aware of the mascara that coursed down her
cheeks, leaving dark rivulets, smeared here and there where she'd wiped at her
tears. Even through the mess, he thought she looked beautiful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This time you're
calling <i>me</i> back?" She managed a crooked smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You can't go back
in there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He motioned around
his eyes and down his cheek, not wanting to actually tell her she was a mess.
She got the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh. Thank you,"
she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He might come
back. You really need to get out of here. I suggest you have your meeting with
your friend someplace else."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I have no plans
to stay, but thank you." She spoke softly as she rubbed her face with  her
hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark noticed her
composure was back. Whatever else was true about this woman, she had
demonstrated she was very strong, resilient. As she wiped at her face with her
hands, their eyes locked for a moment. His mind was immediately overwhelmed
with a familiar pang of loneliness and longing and the resolute hope that a
woman so beautiful could find her way past her troubles and into the arms of a
warm and loving man. Just as quickly as they'd come, though, the thoughts
disappeared, moved to an unproductive area of his brain where extraneous ideas
are deposited to die. The present sidebar to his mission was a mistake, and he
had to ensure it wouldn't happen again. From now on, if he needed a beer, he'd
drink it in his room. But he needed to see this one through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look, I really
don't feel good about leaving you here now. So if you'll let me, I'd like to
run a little interference for you on your way to wherever you're going."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And how do you
plan on doing that?" She asked, trying to force a smile that wasn't there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just give me a
description of Chuck's car. We can caravan until you get about a mile from
where you're going. When you're there, tap your brakes three times. I'll pull
off to the side of the road and stick around the area for about a half hour
just to make sure he didn't follow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why the change in
heart? You seemed to be in such a big hurry earlier." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark could feel
her appraising him with her eyes. It made him feel nervous and warm all at
once. It was the right look at the wrong time. It was a look he longed for but
couldn't acknowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just want to make
sure you make it out of here in one piece. Promise. It goes no further than
that." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri nodded,
turned toward the bar, then stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Joe?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah." Clark
cringed at the sound of the name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'd really like
the opportunity to thank you for this somehow. I'd like to buy you lunch or
coffee if you'll let me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sure." He wasn't
good at lying. It didn't appear to him, however, that she'd noticed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thanks," she
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri took a
moment to gather herself, smiled at Clark, then returned to the bar to retrieve
her friend. </p>
