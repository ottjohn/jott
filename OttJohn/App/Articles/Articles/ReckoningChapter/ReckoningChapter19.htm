<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked down at
his almost-empty plate, the nutrients it held minutes ago now participating in
his digestive process, working to repair his muscle fibers, helping him to
think more clearly, and, unfortunately, tipping him toward the characteristic
lethargy that accompanies epic consumption. Carri had grilled the steak to
perfection, a medium-rare rib eye, well marbled, with a tender, juicy
consistency he could only describe as moving. The steak had been accompanied by
silky smooth garlic mashed potatoes, and a salad made with lots of green leafy
foliage, nuts, fruit, and avocado. He'd never been much of a fan of salads, but
he figured if he could get them all to come out like Carri's, he might just
give them another chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Really delicious.
I'm not sure when's the last time I had a meal this good. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You bought the
food.&quot; She smiled, cradling her face in her hands as she looked directly
into his eyes, as if daring him to hold her gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Anyone can buy
food,&quot; he protested. &quot;It's the preparation that's the most important
part of any meal, so it's the cook who's owed the gratitude.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took a sip of his
beer, some imported German brand he'd never heard of before. He took the final
bite of his steak, diminishing the quantity of digestible nutrients on his
plate to trace amounts. He pushed his chair back from the table, then stretched
his hands high above his head and took a large gulp of air with a single, giant
yawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri waved off the
apology. &quot;No need. When's the last time you slept?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think I might
have gotten a couple of hours' last night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri stood up, walked
around the table, and took Clark's hand. He got to his feet, and she lead him
through the living room and down a narrow hallway that provided access to three
bedrooms and a large bathroom. He followed her into one of the bedrooms, where
she walked him to the foot of a over-sized queen bed. It was decked out with a
pink comforter adorned with red heart shapes, a mountain of large pillows in black
silky cases almost spilling over both edges. The bed itself was tucked neatly
within a wooden, four-post frame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She looked up into his
eyes, then pointed at the bed. &quot;You need to get some rest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He didn't know what to
say. He was tired. He needed rest. But he also knew sleeping now would take
away much of the remaining time he might have with her. He wasn't sure what the
night held for him, but he was confident a few cups of strong coffee would get
him through whatever he'd have to face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I appreciate what
you're doing, Carri, but I'm okay. I just need a little coffee.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri shook her head.
&quot;No, Jack. What you <i>need</i> is a little sleep, just enough to recharge
you.&quot; Then her voice choked just a little, &quot;Please? I want you to be
okay, Jack. Don't go out there tired.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark closed what
little space there was between them, wrapped his arms around her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're probably
right. But I only need about a half an hour. Anything  more is going to add to
my exhaustion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He kissed the top of
her head, then sat down on the bed and watched her leave. Physically, he wasn't
that tired. Mentally, he felt drained. But he was accustomed to operating like
that. Over the past couple of years, he'd grown used to the endless nights that
had so many times melted into the morning light. And he wanted to spend more
time with her, didn't want to lose even another minute. He thought for a moment
about walking back into the kitchen, taking her in his arms again. It felt good
to hold her, felt like home. He allowed himself a smile, something he'd noticed
he'd done more of since he'd met her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then reality hit him
like a runaway Mack truck: he had a promise to keep. Nothing could stand in his
way. Not even Carri. He was suddenly struck by a jab of anguish. A man lost in
revenge, past the point of no return. Out of nowhere, an angel had come to him,
had shown him he actually could enjoy another's company, smile again. But the
smiles came with a painful longing of what might have been, hardened with the
awful acceptance of what could never be. He stripped to his underwear, then lay
down on the bed. His head hit the pillow like a lead weight. Less than a minute
later, he was out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He woke to the feeling
of a slight vibration, wondered through sleep-induced fog if there had been an
earthquake. If it were a temblor, it couldn't have been too bad. Probably not
even a four. Nothing to worry about, so he decided to close his eyes for a few
more minutes before getting up to prepare himself for what lay ahead. Then he
felt another sensation. Hands. On his back. Carri's hands. He rolled over,
found Carri lying next to him, stripped to her underwear. He figured Carri was
a woman who'd look good, elegant even, dressed in a garbage bag. The site of
her in her underwear, however, did nothing short of take his breath away. He
spent a moment drinking her in, found himself a little self-conscious at his
reaction. Carri seemed to understand, put her forefinger to her lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Relax, big guy.
I'm not going to bite you. Just want to spend more time with you.&quot; Her
smile quickly disappeared and she cast her eyes down at the comforter. Her nose
crinkled just a little, and her eyebrows furrowed as if she were in pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jack. I uh ...
I'm never going to see you again after tomorrow, and that hurts like hell. I know
this is going to sound crazy, but I've fallen for you. Hard. But at the same
time ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Small tears welled up
in her eyes, flowed down her cheeks, and plunged to the soft fabric of the
comforter, soaking it with the salty sorrow of a lost past that could only be
realized in a blissful dance through an impossible future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;At the same time,
I know you have to do what you have to do. I want you to. I want you to find
peace. I want you to be happy. But for now ... for right now, please don't deny
me from experiencing just this once what might have ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before she could get
out another word, Clark stopped it with a soft kiss to her lips. He wasn't sure
if it was the right thing to do, but he no longer cared. He'd rescued her; then
she'd returned the favor. They'd built a bond in a matter of days that takes
most people a lifetime create. As he kissed her lips and the nape of her neck
with more urgency, he pushed the anguish of having to leave her to the back of
his mind. He focused on the present, on the little piece of heaven he'd found
in her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Two hours later, Clark
was making his way toward Huntington Park in Chuck's Mustang. The evening had
cooled enough for him to roll down the vehicle's windows, but he chose to keep
them up, use their tint to obscure his identity as he drove along the 110 toward
the Florence Avenue Exit. He'd driven the entire way in compromised silence,
using the blast of the air conditioner to help drown out the noise of the busy
L.A. traffic. He needed to think, and generally, in the absence of quiet, white
noise helped him do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The initial part of his
trip had been dominated by thoughts of Carri. He'd enjoyed the moment, every
second, yet he felt a stinging sense of regret. Making love to her was
wonderful, but it had opened a conduit of doubt about what he'd been doing.
About what he still needed to do. It had demonstrated to him the possibility of
moving on, of starting over. Given his present circumstances, however, he knew
that possibility was hollow at best, simply a plastic shell encasing a reality
that was at once void of future contemplation and over-stuffed with the bleak
certainty of a small cement cell he'd likely call home for the rest of his
life. Was it worth it? The memory of his daughter, what had been done to her,
and how she'd been found pushed all the doubt away. He was on a road with no
exits, shuttling at high velocity toward a outcome he'd been seeking for over
two years. His destination was still a little vague, but he'd get there. Or
he'd die trying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he exited the 110
and headed east on Florence Avenue, the white noise from the air conditioner
lost its effectiveness against the external sounds pressing in from the traffic
around him. His introspection moved to vigilance as he heard a heavy bass beat
vibrating through the tinted windows of a tricked-out Suburban that weaved by
on his left. Suddenly the Suburban slowed, cut across a busy intersection, and
sped up a residential cross-street. A Gang Task Force police vehicle, coming
from the other direction, broadcast a piercing wail and gave pursuit. He didn't
bother watching the drama unfold, simply checked his mirrors, looking now for
two kinds of trouble: police presence and the unwanted attention from
pedestrians who might want to get a closer look at Chuck's Mustang. He reached
under the seat with his right hand, felt the re-assuring grip of the Colt 45.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he continued his
short trek down Florence Avenue, he started to gain an appreciation for the
vehicle he was driving: the model was popular enough to help him blend in with
the traffic around him; the tinted windows ensured his anonymity with respect
to law enforcement. As long as he didn't break any laws and remained
accident-free, he figured he'd be fine. But the Mustang wouldn't perform in the
desert. He'd need a different vehicle for that. So before he left, he'd asked
Carri to search the want-ads for a four-wheel drive vehicle. He didn't much
care about the make, so long as it was newer, in good condition, and ready for
the rough terrain he expected to find just east of Baker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He took a left on
Avalon, then an immediate right into a corner gas station. He parked next to an
older Toyota Minivan. Two black males were leaning against the rear of it. The
man on the left was Joe. Clark noticed he hadn't changed much. Domestic life
had added a little paunch to his six foot frame, but he still had the same
boyish face, large, almost bovine eyes, and jug ears that jutted out from a
cleanly-shaven head. He was dressed in newer, loose-fitting jeans, a black
Raiders t-shirt, and white tennis shoes. The whole ensemble could be described
as gangland conservative: toned down enough to allow him to blend into the
mainstream, yet presenting the appropriate message to keep him out of trouble
in South Central.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He guessed the man on
the right to be Joe's brother, something he would've had difficulty telling
under different circumstances. Jerry wore baggy sweat pants pulled down to the
tops of this thighs, dark blue boxers, a dirty white tank top, and an
over-sized jacket dyed military green. Decorating his head like a trophy from a
mop manufacturer was  a mess of thick, unkempt dreadlocks. He had the same
large eyes as his brother, but contrasting the chocolate-colored complexion on
his face was a long, white, curved scar that stretched from his right ear all
the way to the bottom of his chin. His sweats draped over white sneakers,
partially obscuring them; his hands were thrust deep into the pockets of his
jacket. It was 85 degrees outside. Clark didn't understand the jacket, just
chalked it up to another irrational expression of gangland fashion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As discreetly as he
could, he reached under the front seat, withdrew his gun, and tucked it snugly
between his beltline and the small of his back. He then got out of the Mustang,
walked around the back of the car, and shook his old friend's hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good to see you,
Joe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Joe gave Clark a weary
look. &quot;Good to see you.&quot; He then turned to his brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jerry, this is
Clark, the friend I was telling you about.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry gave Clark a
look, then uttered a single, lazy syllable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sup?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark thought about
extending his hand, but Jerry still had both of his in his jacket pockets. Like
it was the middle of winter and he was cold. So he simply gave him a nod and
turned back to his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks, Joe. I
really appreciate this. I got it from here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A mixture of surprise
and resignation crept into Joe's facial expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You sure? I can
stay if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark smiled. &quot;You
don't need to be in this any deeper than you are. I really appreciate the
offer, though. I hope someday I'll have the opportunity to pay you back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Joe started to raise
his arms in protest, thought better of it, shook his head, and returned to his
van. Jerry and Clark took up position behind the Mustang, and watched Joe drive
away, neither of them really sure about the other, neither really sure about
what to say next. Finally, Jerry broke the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;This your
ride?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It could be
yours. Consider it a gift in return for something I need from you.&quot; Clark
assessed Jerry as he spoke, concluded he wasn't a threat. But Jerry appeared to
be sizing him up. Jerry backed away just a bit, then threw on attitude as
naturally as debutante might throw on a new pair of shoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What the hell can
<i>I</i> do for <i>you</i>, crackah?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Crackah?&quot;
Clark replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. Whitey,
honkey, boy, mutha fucka. Whateva you want. And what you gonna do if I decide
to <i>take</i> your mutha fuckin' car anyway, nigga?&quot; Jerry's arms were
moving out from his body as he spoke, his face pointed up at Clark's, the tone
of his voice purposefully inflected to intimidate. His act may have worked on a
lot of people, but not with Clark. He leaned in close to Jerry's face, getting
near enough so the man could feel his words burst onto him like cannon fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Let's get one
thing straight, son: I'm not a crackah, whitey, homey, or any other derogatory
slang you'd like to throw my way. You will call me Mr. Clark. I'm here to do
business. This car ...&quot; Clark pointed to the Mustang &quot;...is yours in
exchange for a little help. In the meantime, all I ask for is your undivided
attention. Now, if you don't think you're capable of that, Jerry, I can take
the car and my money and find help elsewhere. And if you try to stop me, I'll
put you in the ground. Is that clear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry looked
momentarily confused, then got a look on his face not unlike that of a dog
after having been scolded for messing on the floor. He'd been put in his place,
probably a customary one. Clark briefly wondered why the kid had remained in
the life for so long if he couldn't climb the social rungs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry, gave the car
another look, then smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You gonna give me
<i>that</i> if I help you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's correct,
Jerry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry shrugged, then
extended his hand. &quot;How can I help you, Mr. Clark?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took the man's
hand, grasped it in a firm grip. &quot;What I need we can't talk about here.
You have some place we can go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I gotta place.
Share a crib with my niggas up north of Compton. You square with that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't answer,
just threw Jerry the keys to the Mustang and headed toward the passenger side
of the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After a little more
than an hour's work, Tobias and Carol concluded that most of Eduardo's larger
purchases were centered right around his apartment in Santa Ana. There'd been
plenty of transactions further away, but those were all well within the
boundaries of the greater metropolitan area. All except for three, that is: the
first occurred on March 15th. Eduardo had paid for the services of a company
called Desert Tours. Tobias had quickly searched the company name on the
internet but came up with nothing more than a P.O. Box and a short, vacuous
description, the kind that's not made by the company itself, but by some
third-party web crawler. The second and third transactions occurred on the same
date and reflected two separate purchases at a small gas station within the
town of Baker, California. A single additional transaction on the 14th of March
showed Eduardo withdrawing $500 from a local branch of his bank in Santa Ana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Baker.&quot;
Tobias said, mostly to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You think his
visit there had something to do with his murder?&quot; Asked Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Dunno.&quot; His
answer was short, almost terse. It was a reply built out of a focused immersion
into the possibility, blurred around the edges by a nagging exhaustion. He
spent the next several minutes contemplating Baker, weighing the subjective
probabilities, trying to tie the pieces together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're being
quiet.&quot; She said, frowning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry. You might
be onto something with the Baker angle, though.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She smiled, put her
hands on his shoulders. &quot;Let's share our theories. You know how I love
mutual postulation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias sighed. &quot;I
can't, honey.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why not? I can
handle it. I'm a big girl.&quot; She wagged her forefinger in his face in mock
admonishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias yawned,
stretched his hands above his head. &quot;I know. Sorry I'm a little cranky.
Just really tired.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know you are
Toby Bear.&quot; She pouted at him. &quot;But you're trying to protect me from
something ugly, and you know it. Do you want to talk about it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No.&quot; He said
it a little harshly, immediately regretted his tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know, Paul,
you get these cases, and they take their toll. They weigh on you, sweetie, and,
eventually, the stress fills you up like an over-inflated balloon. If you'd
only talk to me about these things, maybe I could help you reduce a little bit
of that stress. Don't you think?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He understood she was
right. He did tend to get too involved in some cases, especially the ones like
he was working now. And each time he'd over-inflated, she'd bring him back.
They'd never really spoken in-depth about the circumstances surrounding his
work, nothing more than what she'd get from a newspaper, anyway; but even
without the details, she was somehow able to moderate his stress, make the
world feel right again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He said, &quot;I know
you mean well, but I just can't. Please understand I just don't want all this
sleazy grime dripping off you too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol wrapped her arms
around his neck and shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's okay. I just
worry about you. That's my job, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said nothing,
just grabbed his wife's hands and gave the left one a kiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Is Juan still
coming over?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
Tobias looked at his watch. &quot;Shoulda been here by now, actually.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, well, while
you're busy in here all by yourself protecting me from God knows what, I'm
going to get the burgers started.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He watched her leave,
then looked at his wine glass, noticed it was empty. Just as he was about to
heave himself from his chair and trudge to the pantry for another bottle, he
heard the distinctive growl of Sanchez's car pull into the driveway. He went to
the door to greet him. A minute later, they were both back in the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, so what'd
you find out about our guy?&quot; Asked Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;For starters, a
name: Jack Clark.&quot; Sanchez beamed triumphantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave Sanchez a
prideful nod. The kid had been instrumental in a lot of cases he'd worked in
the past, but this is the first time he'd broken one wide open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good work,
kid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez remained quiet,
standing in front of Tobias, drinking in a rare victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So are you going
to tell me what's in the envelope you got there, or do I need to wait for some
kind of end zone dance?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked down at
the envelope in his right hand, gave Tobias a sheepish smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I've been a busy
guy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Do tell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;As luck would
have it, the only vehicle in the lot <i>not</i> registered with the office was
an older model Ford truck. I had a guy from the motor pool come out to open it
up. At first, we found nothing. No registration, no insurance. Nothing. Ran the
plates. Empty again. Turns out, they're stolen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That just leaves
the VIN.&quot; Tobias offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Exactly. Little
metal plate, driver's side, at the very end of the dash, right? It's gone,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked at
Sanchez, puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So how'd you find
him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Auto shop.&quot;
Sanchez smiled. &quot;In high school, I learned the VIN number is also stamped
onto the engine of every car, and it's almost impossible to remove. Once I got
the VIN off the block, I used it to track everything about the history of the truck,
including insurance and registration. Once I got his name, I punched it into
our system. It spat out two reports. &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias grimaced.
&quot;Let me guess: the first one's for his kid, and the other's for his
wife.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You got it. Only
child was a daughter; wife's dead. He's alone, he drives a larger vehicle, and
the stats on his registration state he's six three and 240. Can you believe
that? All those hours we spent with the brass at headquarters appear to have
pegged the guy accurately. Pretty crazy, huh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded; Sanchez
opened the envelope, handed his boss decent headshot of Clark, probably from
his driver's license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So, you want the
details?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned his head
forward, brought his hands up to his face, and rubbed his eyes. He really
didn't want to look at the files, tried to convince himself he could get by
without having to. He knew for certain they wouldn't contain any concrete facts
he didn't already know. Or could guess. So why should he? They now had a face
and a name to go with the crimes; and to top it off, he had a general idea
about where Clark would be in the next couple of days, if not sooner. But he
knew better: information is power, notwithstanding its sometimes wicked
message. While the information in the files might not give him anything more
about the physicality of the man, it might help him understand his psychology a
little better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Give me the short
version. I don't need dates, just the details.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez took a breath,
then let it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Little over two
years ago, Clark's daughter, Jessica, was abducted from a park just outside of 
Glendale. Apparently, her mother was checking on a sick dog some kids had found
underneath a tree. Report says she had her back turned for at most a couple of
minutes, but by the time she turned around, her daughter was gone. An Amber
alert was issued, search parties were formed, but she was never found. At least
not in time. Fast forward six months: a couple of desert rats are out riding
their dual sports up in the wilderness just south of San Bernardino. One of
them sees what he thinks is a dead animal. He rides up for a closer look and
finds Jessica instead. Coroner report said the girl was infected with all kinds
of STD's. It also said she was left out in the desert alive. She had a broken
leg and was likely in shock, but in the end dehydration and exposure got her.
She was eight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jesus Christ.
What about the wife?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Suicide. Clark's
own words in the report expressed she never got over the abduction, blamed
herself for it. She slipped into alcoholism then depression, finally couldn't
take it anymore and took an overdose of prescription medication on the
anniversary of her daughter's disappearance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Suddenly Tobias felt
very tired again. But there was something else there, too. Anger. &quot;The
desert?&quot; He said it like it just hit him. &quot;My granddaughter's about
that age. What in God's name is wrong with these people?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;These aren't
people, boss. They're less than animals. Don't even belong in our gene pool, in
my opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias got up from his
chair, walked over to the pantry, and pulled out a fresh bottle of wine. Pinot
Noir this time. He didn't want something too heavy. He uncorked the bottle,
poured three glasses, gave one to Sanchez and placed the other on the counter for
Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;This guy's fueled
himself with rage for over two years. He's been visualizing an outcome, and
he's committed to making it happen.&quot; Tobias said, almost matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, and he's
well-prepared too.&quot; Sanchez added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took a sip of
his wine, then placed the glass on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can't be <i>that</i>
well-prepared; otherwise, his truck wouldn't be sitting in the parking lot of
that apartment complex. Unless, of course, you <i>did</i> roll up right as he
was finishing up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Unlikely, unless
he likes babysitting corpses. The pathologist at the scene said the body temp
was right at 96 degrees, which means the time of death was fairly early in the
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He might have
abandoned it, then. But why would he abandon it there? Makes absolutely no sense.
He's been smart all along. This isn't his style. Something must have forced him
away from his truck. Maybe he intended to retrieve it later.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez  just shrugged
and shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;At any rate, I
think we're going to have to assume he knows where they took his daughter. But
he's tied up now because he needs a vehicle. That's going to take a little
time, which gives us a little breathing room.&quot; He paused for a moment,
thinking, then said, &quot;But he has to know we're closing in. We've got his
truck. Even with all the work he did to deflect discovery with respect to its
ownership, he's smart enough to know we're going to be able to get a history
from it. So his sense of urgency has to be in orbit right now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Guy like that,
motivated, he's probably already got another set of wheels. Hell, he's probably
there right now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Maybe not. My
money's on him hitting this place sooner rather than later, but he's more than
likely going to do a little recon before he moves on it. From what we know
about him, that's just the way he works. But once he gets the lay of the place,
he's going to be on them like the plague.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez took a sip of
his wine, made a face a child might make when biting into something bitter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't you people
ever drink beer like the rest of us po' folk?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Beer, my son, is
for pedestrians. You stick with me, and I'll show you how to pass off affluence
like a bad haircut. But it all starts with the wine. Besides, it's good for
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez was quiet for a
moment, then said, &quot;So what are we going to do, boss? Hell, we have no
idea where this place even is. By the time we find it, he'll have done his
business and split.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But we <i>do</i>
have an idea about where it is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We've got a
general location. The only anomalous activity in Eduardo's bank account points
to Baker. More than likely, there's a dummy corporation hanging out up there
doing business as Desert Tours. It's probably used to ferry customers to and
from their more lucrative operation. You up for a trip to the desert tomorrow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tomorrow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave Sanchez a
tired smile. &quot;Under the circumstances, I don't see we have much of a
choice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark watched the
scenery roll by as Jerry drove the Mustang east on Florence then south on
Compton. Until recently, he'd been accustomed to the relative comfort afforded
by a middle-class lifestyle. He never had a lot of money. He worked hard at
what he did, saved, invested, bought a house, built a reality around him far
and away foreign from what he was now watching. Underlying the dirt and the
violence and the tension in South Central L.A. was a layer of security he
figured was a simple reality for the working class people who did their best to
get by in a community under siege by gang violence. Wrought iron bars were
everywhere. Roll-up metal garage doors sealed tight the fronts of shops and
street-facing windows. Patrol cars specially equipped to survive bullets,
explosives, and riots patrolled the streets. He'd lived in places where he
could leave his home and his vehicle unlocked without having to worry about
theft. At one time in his life he was naive enough to believe that a sense of
security was supposed to be part of the American dream. As he grew older, he
understood there was no such thing. But Compton didn't even look like America.
He may have just as easily been in Beirut. He felt his pocket vibrate, pulled
his attention away from the urban blight scrolling by. He removed his phone,
saw it was Carri.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark.&quot; He
always answered the phone by simply stating his last name. He felt a little
awkward doing so this time. They had shared something special, and he felt she
deserved a little more than a terse recitation of his surname.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hi. I found two
vehicles you might be interest in so far. You have a minute?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, tell me
about them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, the first
one's a Jeep. It's a 2003 Wrangler, has 85 thousand miles, and it's supposedly
in really good condition. The second is a 2002 Ford Crew Cab. I thinks it's
like a ... yeah, the ad says it's a 350? It has 150 thousand miles on it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He did a quick
analysis: the Jeep would give him versatility, but it would fall well short of
offering him the protection he was looking for. That's the risk of driving a
low-profile vehicle. Further, it wouldn't provide any kind of sleeping space
he'd require if he were lucky enough to get out of the mess he was heading
into. The truck, on the other hand, would be a rolling fortress, would have
plenty of room to stretch out on the many nights he'd find himself without a bed.
The downside would be the exposure he'd risk driving such a large vehicle. And
it had a lot of miles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What kind of fuel
does the truck take?&quot; The question was posed to break the stalemate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The description
said it's a turbo diesel. So I guess that's the kind of gas it takes,
right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How much?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The guy wants a
little more than 19 grand for it. The Jeep has an asking price of a little over
14.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Call the guy with
the truck. Tell him you'll pay what he wants. You know where the money is,
right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm assuming it's
in your briefcase.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Right. Take 25
out. When I finish my business here, I'll give you a call and we can pick up
the truck later tonight. Make sure the guy's willing to sell tonight,
okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Will do.&quot;
She paused.  &quot;Jack?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Are you
okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He thought about the
question. Okay with respect to what? He was presently driving toward Compton in
the passenger seat of a stolen car that belonged to a dead man. He didn't know
the driver at all, and he had no idea what sort of challenges his current
destination might bring. But he felt comfortable with it. He'd already
convinced himself he'd get through this part of his mission. His relationship
with Carri, though, troubled him. Much more so than a pending confrontation
with a bunch of hardcore gang members. He found it terrifying and exhilarating
all at once. But the destination with respect to Carri was far from uncertain.
It was a dead end. They both knew it. And he figured neither one of them were
okay with it. But in the end, he knew meeting her was something he'd never
regret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm fine,&quot;
he lied, then slapped the phone shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By the time Clark ended
his conversation, Jerry was pulling into the short driveway of a green stucco
home. It was a squat, simple, blocky house, one of tens of thousands built in
California during the 1950's post-war boom. And it looked well-maintained, too.
Compared to what he'd seen on his way in, the house and the others around it
were in a great state of repair, their lawns looked well kept, and their street
was free from clutter. At the front of the house was a small porch, its
perimeter stretched by a dark brown, decades-old couch. There were two black
men sitting on it, enjoying a beverage and an evening smoke. They were
illuminated by a feeble yellow light that was swaying gently in the dying Santa
Ana wind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man on the left was
so small the cushions on the couch nearly wrapped completely around him,
obscuring much of him from view. Light from the lamp reflected off the top of
his balding head, which was girded around the sides with close-cut gray hair.
He had a razor sharp face and a wide nose, upon which was perched a pair of
thick glasses set in black plastic frames. His emaciation was exaggerated by
over-sized clothing that clung to his body, fabric that desperately attempted
to find support in sharp, angular places, succumbing to gravity where it
couldn't. He looked distinguished, like he could've been an Emeritus Faculty
member at any number of colleges or universities in the area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man on the right
was a different story altogether. He was large. While he couldn't determine his
height, Clark figured the guy had to weigh north of 300 pounds. He had a big,
round, meaty face and a bald head. He wore a black, short-sleeved shirt that
barely accommodated the massive muscularity that rose and fell on him like
mountains off a valley floor. Upon seeing Clark, the big man got up from his
seat, revealing a stature that would put him about a half a head above his own
height. He then moved in front of the older man to assume a protective
position. The light on the porch bounced off his forearms, illuminating a
proliferation of tattoos. The kind a guy might get in prison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark and Jerry exited
the car, then moved toward the two men. The thin man used his right hand to
move the big man to the side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's
this?&quot; He asked, gesturing toward Clark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry replied,
&quot;Friend of my bro's. Said he need our help. Gave me this car to get it.
Said he need sumthin from us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Like what?&quot;
The thin man's countenance changed. He looked at Jerry with impatience mixed
with a little anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry said nothing. The
thin man fixed his gaze on Clark, giving him a look void of trust, stuffed with
suspicion. He stubbed out his smoke on the railing in front of him and exhaled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What you want,
coming into this neighborhood, boy? Don't you know there's no whites here?
Could get yourself killed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The thin man was the
leader, and that was probably good news. Generally, no matter who you are, age
comes with patience and reason. But it can also come with the heavy weight of
perception, cemented firmly by a lifetime of negative experiences. Clark was
acutely aware he symbolized the face and the color behind the perception, a
member of the white class that had worked systematically to discriminate
against the black community, effectively dumping them like so much trash into a
social hole from which there was no escape. And now here he was standing in
this man's yard. Getting ready to ask for his help. He figured he'd try a
reasonable approach first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm not here to
cause any problems. And the kind of help I need shouldn't be discussed out in
the open. Can we step inside and have our conversation there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The big man said,
&quot;Ain't no way no white boy's gonna step inside the pofessa's house.&quot; His
voice was deep, intimidating. It seemed to shake the air with an angry
vibration. Clark took a quick glance at Jerry, who briefly met his gaze and
then quickly turned away. It betrayed his status in the house and told Clark
that this was his mess, good or bad. Clark shrugged, held up his hands, and
took a step back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fine by me. I'm
sure I'll have no trouble finding people much more organized and much more
reasonable, who'll gladly accept a fee and a car in return for what I'm looking
for.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don' need yo'
kind here; don' want yo' kind here, white boy. Get yo' car and get da fuck out
'fore someone gotta come and take yo' ass out in a bag.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark ignored the big
man, just looked at the professor, who now sat impassive, outwardly showing 
neither thought nor emotion. Time to force his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jerry!&quot;
Clark called. &quot;Need my keys, son!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He used the slightly
derogatory vernacular to send a jolt through the old man, to appeal to his
seniority to take control of the conversation. But the professor remained
silent, appeared content to hand his voice to the big man, who continued
directing his warnings at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Son? Fuck you,
honkey! And what makes you think we gonna let you take yo' car, anyway? You
don' get yo' white ass outta here now, you gonna be leavin' in a bag or
shufflin' naked down the boulevard. Get yo' keys an' go. Now!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The big man's arms were
swelling in front of his heaving chest. In spite of his posture, Clark knew
he'd been holding himself back. He figured, though, that wouldn't last too much
longer. The heaving in his chest meant his testosterone and adrenaline were
notching up. He was getting ready to take some kind of action. Clark again
shifted his attention to the professor, wondered if he'd step in if he pushed
it just a little further. If he had more time, he'd simply back off and find
another way to get what he needed. But time was something he didn't have much
of; in fact, it may have already run out, depending on what the police knew
about him. He had to take a gamble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Park the
aggression, big guy. I'm not here to compare Johnsons. Just needed a little
assistance. That's all. If you can't find it within you to help me out, then I
guess I'll have to go somewhere else. And I'll be taking the car.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark turned to walk
toward Jerry, who slowly backed away. As he took his first step, he saw
movement from the big man, saw his hand reach into the front of his pants,
where he could see the butt of a handgun. Clark kept his stance partly facing
Jerry and partly facing the two men on the porch. In one smooth, quick motion,
he moved his right hand to the small of his back, grabbed the grip on his gun,
and swung his arm so its barrel was pointing right at the big man's gut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Big mistake if
you do. I said I'll be going now. Don't make me have to kill you on my way
out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The professor stirred a
little and then stood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Put your gun
down, Tiny.&quot; He spoke softly, but his voice ran deep with the sound of
disappointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny kept his arm
outstretched, pointing the barrel of a nine millimeter semi-automatic at
Clark's forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I said put the
gun down, Tiny!&quot; This time his voice had a growl in it, the disappointment
giving way to anger. &quot;If this man's a friend of Jerry's brother, then I
guess we can listen to what he has to say. If we don't like it, he can take his
car and get on down the road.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny frowned and
returned his gun to his beltline. The old man shook his head to the left and
right, grunted, then focused his attention on Clark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Put your piece in
your car. You gonna come into my house, <i>son</i>, then you gonna live by my
rules.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't see any
reason to hesitate. He lowered his weapon, opened the passenger side of the
Mustang, and slipped the gun under the seat. He got the keys from Jerry, locked
the car, then made his way up to the porch. The professor waited for him at the
top of the steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's your name,
son?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, you got
yourself some big old brass balls, Clark. Now let's go inside before we get the
police all up in our business.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark entered the professor's
home, wasn't surprised to see it orderly and well-kept. While the age of every
piece of furniture could be measured in decades, and the appliances looked as
though they'd come with the house, all of it was well-maintained, clean, and
functional. On the whole, the place was unremarkable, like any other house he'd
been in. Except for the walls. Where most people might have prints or pictures
or paintings hanging, the professor had maps. There were five in all, each
detailing the layout of a single square block of homes. He was struck by their
precision: each home was scrutinized, showing the location of doors, windows,
garages, even trees and shrubs. Most of the homes were branded with a blue
circle while a few were marked in red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why all the maps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The professor regarded
Clark in a neutral manner, gestured to an old, gray couch. &quot;All in good
time. Have a seat. Tell us why you're here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark spent the next
twenty minutes recounting what he'd been doing over the past two years. He
provided most of the salient details, including his botched interrogation of
Hassenback, his breakthrough with Eduardo, and his altercation with Chuck. He
figured they'd need to know about Chuck if they were going to take possession
of the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he spoke, he noticed
the stress in the room markedly decrease. Jerry remained fixed on the couch
throughout, nodding occasionally at most of what he had to say. The professor
sat in his chair, listening intently, eyes moving from a look of distrust and
contemplative skepticism to one of compassion, tinged by more than a little
outrage. It appeared to be a look the man wore a lot, like a garment he didn't
necessarily like but one he had to wear to service himself and others around
him more effectively. Tiny was the only one who didn't stay throughout:
two-thirds of the way through, he'd got a lost look in his eyes, hung his head
briefly, got up from the couch, walked to a rear room, and slammed the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They didn't seem like
gang bangers, fell short of his perception of how he figured they should
behave. They appeared to be good people, good listeners. He returned his gaze
to the maps on the wall. Suddenly, he knew what they were about: they weren't
detailed illustrations meant to give the professor and his crew leverage when moving
against the homes they depicted; they were strategic devices to better
understand the neighborhoods, to provide the information they needed to better
protect them. He figured that wasn't good news for him. He turned again to the
professor, hoping he was wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;My little girl
was my life. My wife was my best friend. They took everything from me, sir. Now
I've found them. And I need to go get them. But before I can do that, I need
...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You need
hardware,&quot; interrupted the professor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The professor stood up
from his chair and walked toward Clark. His gait was easy and smooth, his face
held an expression that told Clark in no uncertain terms what he'd already
figured out. These people were about peace and maintaining harmonic living, not
about vengeance and vigilantism. Sure, they'd do what was necessary to protect
their neighborhoods, but it was obvious their game was based on defensive
strategy, not offensive campaigns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Son, I wasted my
entire youth on violence. Thirty years of it. Ten of those, I was locked up.
It's a poison that rots our community. Keeps us down. About ten years ago, I'd
had enough. Started talking with gang leaders, telling them what's what. Told
them we needed to get along, not fight. It'd be better for us. Some of them
listened; some didn't. Those who didn't listen ... well, we drove 'em out. And
we keep 'em out. Over the past couple of years, the neighborhood's been slowly
getting better. I'm almost sixty and right now this place right here is the
most peaceful I've seen it. Ever. We're about keepin' the peace right now,
Clark. Not finding trouble. I feel you, I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Maybe if the cops weren't right on your ass, I'd be in a different position,
son. But I can't be taking a risk that might bring them around our hood, you
understand?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Bullshit!&quot;
Tiny's voice boomed into the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked at the big
man. He'd changed. He was wearing a tight-fitting black t-shirt, black pants,
black jump boots, and a black knit cap. Hanging from his right hand was a large
gray duffel bag, stretched almost to the floor by the weight of something
substantial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A scowl crossed the
professor's face as he looked toward the big man. &quot;Tiny, we can't. We
gotta be taking care of our own, son. Defensively. Not waging some war 'gainst
some people we don't know about. And you know this man's got the police on his
ass right now. We get in with this it's likely to bring us trouble. Big
trouble. We got our community to think about, brotha.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Bullshit.&quot;
Tiny said again, this time more gently out of respect for the old man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The professor lowered
his head, shook it from side to side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny turned his
attention to Clark. &quot;Sorry, bro, but I got to protect, you understand?
Every one of us been hit with shit, man. Every one. Fuckin' hood is full of
niggas don't know how to respect a life. They bad; we take care of it. Know
why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark shifted his
position on the couch, regarded the bag clutched in Tiny's hand, then focused
on the big man. &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cause we <i>badder</i>
than all them punks, that's why. I put some down. Buried 'em. To protect our
people. They was nothin' but trash. Pofessa tell you same. Jerry too. So will
every member of our crew that roam the street day and night cleaning the bad
niggas off it. They ain't no place for it, know what I'm sayin'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark nodded his head,
wondered if Tiny was gearing up to make a point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just like they
ain't no place for no motha fuckin' child fucka's either. That's part of my
pain, Clark. My sista ...&quot; He paused, swallowed hard, then continued.
&quot;My little, baby sista was taken from me in the same way. Cops never found
who did that shit. Cops didn't care about no black child anyhow. She dead
'cause of some punk ass motha fucka wanta get his nut with a child. Fuck that!
They need to be cleaned up just like our hood do. So I got you your hardware.
But they only one way you gonna get it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How's that?&quot;
Clark asked, already knowing the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You gotta take me
too. I need this. 'Bout as bad as you need it. Ain't no day ... &quot; He
paused again, looking for composure, nearly finding it. &quot;They ain't no day
don't go by I don't think about it. No day. You got a bunch of these niggas
found, I want in. Cops or not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The deference on the
part of Tiny was still there, but the professor's expression clearly showed
there was no way he was going to stop the big man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know the
rule, Tiny,&quot; the professor said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny looked at the
smaller man, then walked up to him, placed a giant hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know pops. I
gotta do this. You my pops, right? And you'll always be here.&quot; He took his
hand from the professor's shoulder and pointed at his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The professor let out a
resigned sigh. &quot;Okay. We gotta get you two out of here quietly.
Safely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jerry offered, &quot;I
can get them out, no problem, pofessa.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How's that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I got my man
Terry down the block. I got the Nova; he got the Grand Prix. I lead, he follow.
When we see a cop look like he gettin' interested, we decoy. Get 'em out that
way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark turned to the
young man. &quot;You sure you want to do that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Shit, man, what
they gonna do, bust me and throw my ass in jail for a couple of days? Been
through that shit before. 'Sides, you the man to my bro. Least I can do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said,
&quot;Decent plan. How long before we can arrange it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Right now.&quot;
Jerry pulled out a flip phone and punched in the number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It took twenty minutes
of careful driving to get the Mustang out of South Central. As they moved
through the gang-infested inner city, Clark counted no less than 15 patrol
cars, none of which showed the slightest interest in them. Jerry led them on
the quickest possible route to the 710, then took them north just short of the
interchange for the Five. As they approached the exit, Jerry slowed down,
allowing them to pass. He flashed his high beams once and continued on the 710
as Clark and Tiny headed north into L.A. As they moved up the Five, Clark could
feel the tension flow out of the cracked windows of the vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So when we movin'
on this place?&quot; Asked Tiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You sure you want
to do this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I told you I need
this. I just never had no target. But this'll do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd never considered
going in with anyone else, always planned for a one-person assault against
whatever he found. The addition of Tiny could be a good thing. Or it could be a
bad thing. It all depended on Tiny. But he needed the hardware, and if Tiny's
presence was the only way he was going to get it, like it or not, he figured he
had himself a partner. Maybe that would change by morning. Part of him hoped
so. He looked over at Tiny, answered the question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Early tomorrow
morning. Before the sun gets up. We need to be in the desert just before dawn
so we'll have a little cover.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds
good.&quot; Tiny paused briefly. &quot;Hey, Clark?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks, bro. For
letting me come along. I ain't lyin' sayin' I need this bad.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Tiny turned to look
out the passenger window, Clark removed his cell and punched in Carri's number.
She gave him the address to a house in Glendale. Thirty minutes later, they
were there. After a quick transfer of cash for title, Clark stepped into his
new vehicle, fired it up, and caravanned with Carri and Tiny the remaining
eight miles to Crescenta Highlands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nice place,&quot;
said Tiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They were standing at
the base of the driveway, Carri looking up at the big, black man looming over
her, her face mixed with concern and surprise. Clark sensed her wavering lack
of comfort and made the introduction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Carri, this is
Tiny. He's a new friend of mine. He's going to help me out over the next couple
of days.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Pleased to meet
you, ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Very pleased to
meet you, Tiny. Any friend of Jack is a friend of mine.&quot; Carri extended
her hand. Tiny took it, enveloping it completely in his, and then released it.
There was a short silence, then Clark said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, I want to
be on the road by five, so we need to get bunked down.&quot; He looked at Carri.
&quot;You mind if Tiny here takes the couch for the night?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri shook her head.
&quot;Nonsense. I have an extra bed. Grab your things, come on in, and I'll
show you where it is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ten minutes later, the
lights were out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The phone call came at
ten in the evening. Rick stretched out on his hotel bed and let it ring,
decided not to answer it. Not this time, anyway. They'd call back. They always
did.  He had to collect his thoughts. Figure out what to say to them. He wasn't
worried about the girl; he had that under control. He was more worried about
what he'd done to Jason. Thinking back, he figured he may have made a mistake
in killing him. It wasn't that he felt bad about what he did to Jason. The guy
was stupid beyond reason, and stupidity leads to situational aggravation that
can get a guy killed. And last time he checked, he still enjoyed breathing. But
killing a co-worker autonomously, without the approval from the bosses, may
have been an act they wouldn't take lightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He doubted it would
cost him his job. But it could cost him his collection fee. And that was
something he'd have to avoid at all costs. He wanted to move on, get away from
the slime he was working for. It was good money, but it was no longer worth it to
him. So he had to find a way to phrase what he'd done to Jason to make it sound
like it was a service to them. He'd racked his brain all day on it, couldn't
find a way of formulating it other than to say Jason had gone bad on them, was
going to go to the cops. But how likely was that? A career criminal working for
a bunch of sleazy pedophiles going to the police? Not very.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He sat up in bed,
pulled his knees to his chest, and thought some more. He knew the story
wouldn't work. He tried again to create a more believable scenario, something
he could tell the bosses that would make them think he had no choice in the
matter, a situation in which letting Jason breath would've been unconscionable.
But he couldn't focus. His mind wandered to a visualization of Jason, his
mistake on the phone, when he finally understood the need for the lateral
language that would keep the details out of the conversation while still
effectively communicating mission status. <i>Oh ... gotcha!</i> Stupid fucker.
In the history of the world, he figured no one had it coming more than Jason
had. He took another sip of his beer, felt his bladder protest. He got up from
the bed, started to head to the bathroom when his phone rang again. This time
he picked up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Rick.
Speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where the hell have
you been?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The voice belonged to
Manheim. While he'd talked to the man almost two or three times a day when
receiving direction during operations, he' d only seen him in person once. The
guy looked like a gigantic, thin worm with greasy, gray hair and big, thick glasses.
He didn't like him much, but he respected him. He respected him for the very
thing Jason had lacked: intelligence. Manheim was one smart son of a bitch. And
if anyone would understand what he'd done to Jason, it'd be him. Suddenly, he
felt better about the call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Been busy, boss.
Sorry. What's up?&quot; <i>Extract name, insert boss. Simple, Jason. Why the
hell couldn't you keep that straight?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I just stuck my
ass out on a line for you, that's what. And if you don't deliver tomorrow, it's
going to be cut off and fed to the local wildlife.&quot; Manheim sounded
concerned. He'd always sounded paranoid, but Rick figured that was more of a
built-in side-effect of his condition more than anything else. But this time he
heard genuine fear in the man's voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No worries, boss.
I've got you. It's all laid out. I'll have the package in the morning.&quot;
Rick paused, let out a breath, then said, &quot;Then I'll <i>personally</i>
deliver it to you two hours later. Guaranteed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No go with that
plan. Your alternate can do the delivery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can't.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What do you mean
you <i>can't</i>?&quot; The voice on the other end of the phone nearly
shrieked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Because Jason's
not around no more. I terminated our partnership.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was a long pause
on the line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What the hell did
you do?&quot; Manheim asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick let out another
breath, said, &quot;Look, man, you didn't have to ride around with that idiot
all the time. He never followed protocol, he was sloppy with operational
jargon, he was obvious in everything he did, and he couldn't engage a guy in a
decent conversation to save his life. He was stupid. He was a walking disaster.
He was going to cause a lot of problems for us. So I figured I had no choice
but to let him go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim paused briefly.
Rick could almost hear his mind working on the other end of the line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I had the same
concerns when we hired him. For some reason, there was a push to get him on
staff. Not sure why. Maybe the chief needed clarification that there was
actually someone in the world with less cerebral horse power than he has. In
any event, that was not something you were authorized to do, for various
reasons. But now that it's done ...&quot; Manheim paused again. Rick knew what
he was thinking, knew he wanted confirmation that all the loose ends were tied
up and concealed from view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;To answer your question,
yes. We went to the desert and had a little cookout. We even worked for an hour
or so digging a fire pit, you know, for the steaks. Then we had a couple of
beers, ate, reminisced about old times, and then I broke the news to him. In
the end, he didn't complain at all. Afterward, we went our separate ways.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cooking pits are
dangerous in the desert, Rick, especially with these damn Santa Ana's. You make
sure you covered it up so there'd be no chance of a fire after you left?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can't even tell
it was there, boss.&quot; Rick let the words hang on the line for a moment,
then said, &quot;Look, I know I didn't have the authority to let the guy go
like that. But he was going to cause us a lot of problems. It was just a matter
of time. I hope this isn't going to cost me my fee.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You get that
package to us tomorrow before noon, and that won't be a problem. In fact, you
deliver as promised, I'll see to it personally you get Jason's fee too. I don't
see why you shouldn't; after all, you performed both jobs. But, Rick, listen to
me ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;This diversion
from protocol can't happen again. It brings too much risk into our operation.
If it happens again, you might be the one let go. You understand?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick paused, understood
the meaning, knew it wouldn't matter anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Understood.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. Then I'll
see you tomorrow before noon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll be
there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick slapped his phone
shut, did his business in the bathroom, and got back into bed. He leaned over
to the night stand and set the alarm for 5:30 in the morning. Then he hit the
lights. He lay there for a few moments, smiling. He'd get <i>both</i> fees.
Then he'd disappear. He'd start a new life. He thought again about the family
he'd seen in the parking lot of the gas station earlier in the day. Maybe it
wasn't too late for him, after all. He thought about where he might go, figured
he'd itemize the possibilities starting with Mexico and moving on down into
South America. Somewhere around Ecuador, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Crunch</i>. <i>Crunch</i>.
<i>Crunch</i>. The desert floor compressed beneath Tobias as he walked slowly
across a stretch of land he could only describe as desolate and unforgiving.
The ground was  dry, dusty, and spongy, the way an arid region gets a couple of
days after drinking up moisture from a grudging rain. All around him were
photosynthetic life forms, heroically holding onto existence through stubborn
perseverance. But the plants were stunted and fragile, broadcasting in no
uncertain terms to trespassers that the surrounding landscape was inhospitable
to most organisms. He looked down at his boots, saw they were changing color
from a solid black to a subdued grey. The desert working to assimilate him from
the bottom up. As he returned his gaze to the wasteland, the hot, dry wind whipped
his face, systematically working to take from him the moisture it lacked; the
sun burned his scalp with a flameless conflagration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he smelled it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Foul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Like sewage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The familiar repugnance
of death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It wafted on the air
and draped his tongue in decomposition. He stopped and listened, trying to
concentrate over the din of the wind. Then he heard it: the distant buzz of
thousands of flies. He let his eyes focus on the noise, followed the sound to a
faint, chaotic cloud of black not more than a hundred yards away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He felt drawn to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He knew he should go
back to the car, retrieve his kit, protect himself from the toxic gas seeping
out of the rotting corpse ahead. But he couldn't. He walked on. The stench got
worse, made him gag and retch. As he moved closer, to within twenty yards, he
could make out a body. He'd expected an animal; he'd found a human. A small
girl. Young. Long, curly blond hair. In his estimation, she had been about
eight years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He moved to within
three feet of the tiny body then stopped. It was partially lodged at the torso
beneath a lone Spiny Saltbush. She was lying on her back, her face pointing
away. Some of her hair was matted to the ground, woven into the desert floor by
the recent rainfall. The rest of it took up with the wind and stretched away
from her, as if it were trying to escape the horror it was attached to. He
shifted his scrutiny along the length of her corpse, from head to foot. Her
extremities had been ravaged by animals, most likely rodents. Where there had
once been hands and feet, there was now just ragged flesh and protruding bone.
Her skin was discolored and ripped, some of it black, some of it fleshy and
mummified, all of it, here and there, exposing a skeletal structure that had
once supported a living, breathing, healthy child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The cloud of flies
buzzed around him, showing little interest, its members clearly favoring the
dwindling meal offered up by late-stage decomposition. A shift in the wind
caught the putrefaction, swept it over him like an invisible wall of rot. He
attempted to pull his shirt over his mouth and nose, but it was too late: his
eyes began to water, his stomach contracted. The spasm moved along his
esophagus, then out of his mouth in a single, violent dry heave. He bent over,
placed his hands on his knees, and tried to control his breathing. As he did,
the wind brought something else. A sound. A tiny voice. Barely above a
plaintive whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then she moved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias tried to fall
back, but he couldn't. His legs wouldn't work. He felt an electric charge
surge up his body, raising every hair on him as it did. His breathing grew
ragged as he watched the head of the tiny corpse turn slowly upward and then
toward him. Like the body, the face was mostly mummified. Where there had once
been a nose and two eyes, there was now only dark, gaping holes, pits that lead
from the face into the recesses of her head. Her lips were ripped apart and
shrunken; he could see a thriving population of maggots working to process the
rot, feeding on the remaining flesh to produce a new generation of flies. Even
before the head had completed its rotation toward him, he recognized the girl.
He knew the hair, even without its customary bow. He felt his knees give and
his body crumple to the desert floor as he let out a choked scream, a
primordial sob that can only come from the pit of a person's soul upon
realization of a lost loved one. The girl's name was Samantha. The girl was his
granddaughter. As the wind continued to howl, it brought a plaintive cry to his
ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Papa?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No!&quot; Tobias
screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol awoke with a
start, then shook her husband by the shoulder to wake him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Honey? What's
wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He sat up forcefully,
as if trying to move away from something. He curled his feet beneath him and
then moved his hands to his face, putting them to work to stanch the flood of
tears pouring from his eyes. Carol nearly panicked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Honey? Oh my God,
what's wrong? Paul? Look at me!&quot; She moved closer to her husband, wrapping
her arms around him solidly, pushing her face against his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Please, tell me
what's wrong!&quot; She sobbed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He moved his hands away
from his face, stared out into the darkness of his room. He wasn't in the
desert. There was no body. It was a dream. The worst he'd ever had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh God,&quot; he
said softly. &quot;I'm so sorry, sweetie. I had nightmare.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He turned toward her,
gave her a kiss. They both lay back down on the bed, Carol nestled up against
him, her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You want to tell
me about it?&quot; She asked, tears falling onto his chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're
crying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You scared me. I
thought you were having a heart attack,&quot; she choked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He held her more
closely, felt the reassurance of her body next to him, felt his world come back
to him with every breath she took.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm the luckiest
guy in the world. The day I met you, I knew.&quot; He put a finger under her
chin, raising and turning it slightly so she was looking directly at him.
&quot;From that point on, Carol, I've thanked God every single day you're in my
life. The way you feel me, the way you understand me, how much you care ... I
love you so much.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He gave his wife a
kiss, then looked at the clock on his nightstand. It was six in the morning. He
knew there'd be no chance for continued sleep, not with the nightmare still
lurking in the corner of his mind. And he didn't want to share the dream with
Carol, either. He knew she'd understand, wouldn't want to know the horrific
details of what had reduced him to tears.      &quot;I'm going to make some
coffee. You want any?&quot; He said it in a mock-confident voice, filled with a
let's-change-the-subject tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sure. I'll be
down in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He got out of bed, put
on his slippers, and headed to the kitchen. As he made his way down the
hallway, he could still feel the hair on the back of his neck standing on end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias spent the next
hour in the kitchen, splitting time between talking with his wife and thinking
about what lay ahead. He typically liked very structured days, planned out with
an agenda, hour-by-hour. So far, the day was nothing more than an amorphous
blob of time, screaming to be organized. He started off toying with the idea of
calling Michaels and asking for a warrant on Desert Tours. In his mind, there
was no doubt the place existed, no doubt Desert Tours was a front to ferry
customers to and from the main operation. If he could get a warrant for the
company in Baker, he could discretely follow one of the vehicles to its
destination and serve it there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But there was no way
Michaels would go for that. The connections were too loose: no evidence of a
facility that peddles children, no evidence a crime had been, is being, or will
be committed at the facility in question, and no evidence of any kind of a
connection between the facility and Desert Tours. No evidence at all. Just a
strong inclination toward a relationship built out of intuition coming from a
loose assortment of facts. Asking for a warrant under that reality would be a
waste of energy, for both himself and Michaels. So he spent the remaining time
considering ways to conduct surveillance on the tour company without being
overtly obvious. Just as an idea came to mind, Sanchez called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You up yet, old
man?&quot; Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Been up. Figured
I wouldn't call until you finished your bottle. You diapered and ready to
go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Born that way.
What's the plan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You still have
that crotch rocket you use for a penis extension?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;In the garage as
we speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We're going to
need it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez paused for a
moment, then laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why, you want the
bitch-seat on the ride out to the desert?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Funny. I want to
use it for two things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Such as?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;First, the
objective. The only things we're going to be concerned with today is finding
the main facility and determining if Clark beat us to the punch. If we're going
to ascertain its location, we need to locate Desert Tours. Eduardo's purchases
have me convinced it's doing business out of Baker. I figure we'd be pretty
obvious snooping around town in an unmarked, so you're going to have to do that
on your bike. Doubt anyone there will even think twice about it. Desert Tours
is likely nothing more than a shuttle service to the main facility, so once you
find it, look for its vehicles. Hell, the whole business may be nothing more
than a few vehicles parked in a lot somewhere in town. Once you find the
vehicles, just focus on collecting makes, models, and plate numbers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias paused, allowing
Sanchez to reflect on what he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After a moment, Sanchez
said, &quot;okay. What's item number two?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Once you collect
what you need on the vehicles, head back out to the 15. Then you'll get to
assume the role of a testosterone-fueled asshole who screams along the highway
at excessive speeds. Something I'm sure you're good at. We'll play that game
every 15 minutes. You'll pass me; I'll pull you over. We'll keep doing that
until we spot one of their vehicles. Once we get a direction, we'll follow it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You paying for my
gas?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What about wear
and tear on the bike?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't push it.
Letting you run that bike up and down the highway at a 100 miles per hour
should be payment enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez laughed.
&quot;You got that right. Where do you want to meet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Go ahead and take
off now, kid. Meet me in Victorville in about an hour and a half. Don't forget
your cell; I'll give you a call when I get there. We'll get some breakfast and
firm up  our strategy then.&quot;</p>
