<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
pulled up to the Hassenback residence, a now forbidding-looking structure on
the 1100 block of East Wilshire Avenue. Police tape still decorated the front
lawn, marking now dilapidated stay-away zones. Flapping and twirling in a light
breeze, the tape whistled as the wind caught it. Under most other
circumstances, it wouldn't have been an altogether unpleasant sound, but under
the present context, it drew moribund attention to the scene and served as a
reminder of the recent residential mayhem with its restless, plastic cacophony.
Tobias checked his watch, it was 7:15. He really wanted to make this quick, so
he could get back to his little party at home. He wanted another burger. And
another glass of wine. He wanted to visit with his family. He wanted to visit
with his granddaughter. All he had to do was try to remember what it was about
a light switch that was so important to him when taken in context with the
crime scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So are you going
to tell me why we left perfectly good burgers and booze behind so we can go
swimming around a crime scene, or am I going to have to guess?" Sanchez asked,
only half jokingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked at
Sanchez, who was wearing an expectant expression on his face. The kid had
started tagging along with him during his free time a couple of years ago. Not
because Tobias was a really great guy, but because of his solve rate and his
interrogation methodologies. Truth be told, Tobias had no idea how things came
to him at times. They just did. He figured the main reason for his success was
that he didn't force himself on crime scenes. He let them come to him. And that
removed the frustration that can sometimes snag investigations. If you're not
frustrated, you work with a clear head. This time, he had only a partial
answer. He knew what he needed to look for, but he didn't know why. Yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tell the truth,
kid, I'm not really sure myself. All I know is we need to look at all the light
switches in the house.&quot; Tobias pointed at his head with his right index
finger. &quot;It's right there, you know, like the name of someone you're
meeting again for like the second time. You're trying to remember the name
through some stupid association game, but you can't. It's back there in my head
like that. So all I know is light switches. That's the link. Hell, it may not
even be a light switch, but I think looking at them will take us where we need
to go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took his
official copy of the key to the residence, opened the door, and stepped in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, boss?"
Sanchez lagged behind a little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias turned.
Sanchez's face had contorted just a little. His eyebrows leveled over his eyes
under a scrunched forehead, as if he were thinking about something but not sure
he wanted to share. He saw the same expression on his daughter's face probably
a million or so times, in his most conservative estimation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What's bothering
you, kid?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Do you really
want this guy to go down? I mean, in a perfect world, would we even care what
this guy did?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, one, it's
not a perfect world. Two, if there's evidence we overlooked, we need to do
everything we can to find it, notwithstanding how things might be in your
hypothetically perfect world."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, I know."
Sanchez's voice trailed off. He went silent, looked a little deflated. Tobias
knew what was on his mind. He'd been there dozens of times before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look, son, we
all have to do things in life we really don't want to. In this case, the job
description is getting in the way of an ideology. But this is what we do. To
tell you the truth, I don't like it any more than you do. But whether this guy
walks isn't our decision. Our job is to find him and let the lawyers, judges,
and juries ferret out justice. You understand?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. It's our
job. And I love my job, don't get me wrong. I love it a hell of a lot more than
the pleasure I get out of seeing a guy like Hassenback go down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias was
unfazed. He understood. All new cops go through the same process of ideological
reconciliation with their job description. Sanchez was a good cop, and he knew
he would make the adjustment and continue on to make a fine detective one day.
But he still felt compelled to bring Sanchez back to the task at hand, to snap
him back with an obvious argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, if we let
this guy go, we would have two major problems: one, we'd be operating within an
ad hoc justice system, and justice that operates on whimsy is not a place we
want to be for obvious reasons; two, it opens the door for vigilantism. That's
just as bad as ad hoc justice. In fact, it <i>is</i> ad hoc justice. That would
lead to anarchy and chaos. There would be a breakdown in the social system we
worked so hard to forge. Then before you know it, really bad things would start
to happen: dogs might become vegetarians, Paris Hilton might be elected
president, that sort of thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez smiled.
"Vegetarian dogs. You're a mad man."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said
nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I believe in what
I do, boss, but sometimes ... What kind of monster watches that shit?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Don't remind me.
And, yeah, it keeps me up at night too. And you'll never get used to that part
of it. At least I hope you don't. It's just something you have to try to work
through. Now, you gonna be okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Affirmative."
Sanchez relaxed, gave Tobias a sheepish grin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You take the back
part of the house and I'll take the front. We'll meet in the middle," Tobias
directed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said
nothing, just turned and worked his way toward the rear of the house, where the
bedrooms, office, and bathroom were placed around the short hallway. Tobias
loitered in the living room and began inspecting the wall switches there. They
were nestled snugly in their plates, which themselves were screwed tight into
the walls. He flipped a switch. A light came on. He flipped it again. The light
went off. It couldn't have been any of the fixtures or any of the ceiling-mounted
lights. All of those had been searched by the assailant. So what was it about
the light switches? Tobias again looked at a plate. Then he looked at the
screws that mounted the plate to the wall. Then he got it. He was about to call
out to Sanchez when he heard,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Think I found
what you're looking for!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias walked into
the hallway and took an immediate left into the sparsely-equipped office. It
was the closest room to the front of the house, and it had been the very same
room in which he'd had found discovery oversights in his first walkthrough. He
noted to himself he'd need to schedule a little pep talk with the tech who
worked the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I can't believe
I didn't see this," Sanchez said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wouldn't worry
about it too much, kid. Looks like the techs missed it too. And me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked
carefully at the wall-mounted plate. It didn't provide a face for light
switches at all, and that's what was giving him problems. It was just a plate,
a rectangular piece of plastic used to cover a spot where a light switch <i>had</i>
been. In Tobias's experience, such plates were put in place and then left
alone, either until the old switch was resurrected or until the wall and plate
were painted over. Neither of these things had happened to this one. Instead,
unlike any of the other plates in the house, it bore the scars of a few
scratches made by what had to have been a standard screw driver. The tops of
the screws used to mount the plate to the wall showed heavy wear: the
protective coating over them was almost completely gone and the grooves in the
tops of the screws were worn. Apparently, Hassenback had some reason for
removing and replacing this particular plate a lot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Odds?" Tobias
queried Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well," Sanchez
replied, "I wouldn't wager an entire month's pay on it, but I bet there's
something back there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, unless
Hassenback's final guest beat us to it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said
nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, let's get
our gear and find out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
exited the house, retrieved a small standard screwdriver, gloves, and an evidence
bag from the car. They returned to the room, put on their gloves, and removed
the screws that mounted the little vanilla-colored plate. Using the flat end of
the screw driver, they carefully levered the plate from the wall, then stared
into the partially-lighted cavity it had covered. There, inside the wall,
tucked within a plastic sandwich bag, was a metallic thumb drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark worked deep into
the early morning hours reviewing returned files from his first set of search
parameters. He'd learned through trial and error that his most effective
searches were not a product of what one might expect: yes, using key words that
were raw and described accurately what went through the minds of sexual
predators yielded prolific results, but they were also mostly bound up in
twisted fantasy and rarely provided directional vectors to real information.
Further, many pedos who employ salacious verbiage wrought with graphic sexual
descriptions tend to broadcast that behavior into the online world, which puts
them at high risk for electronic surveillance by state and federal authorities;
so targeting that demographic fell outside the bounds of what Clark considered
safe. The smarter demographic, on the other hand, skirts such phrasing in favor
of safer communication invariably planted within exchanges and even careful
marketing blasts about anything from financial opportunities to reminders about
bake sales. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At a very basic level,
there are two types of predators that systematically hunt for children:
individuals who operate alone, prowling favorite chat rooms and social web
sites to groom victims for eventual meetings; and highly-organized groups that
use tactics ranging from abduction to drug addiction to meet the needs of the world's
ravenous sex trade industry. Clark didn't have a lot of use for the loners. He
was after bigger game. It was the organized manifestation of the industry that
had obliterated his family, so he'd keyed on that from the start: every target
he'd selected over the previous two years had a past connected in some way to
organized sex trade involving preteen adolescents. While his last target,
Hassenback, had been incarcerated for the molestation of a minor under the age
of 12, and mostly fit the profile of a lone pedophile who utilized grooming and
confidence to prey on his victims, the evidence brought against him included
allegations of trips to Thailand, a country notorious for sex crimes against
children. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>During her short
life, his daughter at no time went anywhere near Thailand. In the end, she was
found outside of San Bernardino. Alone. In the hot desert sun. Picked apart by
animals and partially mummified by the dry, unforgiving air. The autopsy had
confirmed she'd been a victim of repeated rapes over the span of six months.
The blood work had been at once brutal and revealing: she'd contracted several
sexually transmitted diseases, the number and diversity of which pointed to one
sickening conclusion: she'd been the sexual object of numerous, unknown male
subjects. She was used up, and then she was dumped in the desert. Alive. So
what do you do? Find a pedo who knows how to operate within one organization,
such as any of those running in Thailand, and that <i>might</i> lead you to
another that operates locally. That's all he needed. That's all he thought
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was 2:30 in the
morning. Clark had been looking over Hassenback's documents for several hours
and he was getting tired. He stood and stretched. He looked down at the small,
round table at which he'd been working. His laptop marked an item in a list
indicating the next document he'd read. The blue highlight stood in stark
contrast to the black text and white background. The keyboard glistened under
the harshness of the white light bursting from a bare incandescent bulb burning
above him. It presented a study of an ordered landscape set in shadows and
reflected light. Beside his computer were a pen and a yellow tablet, half the
pages of which were tucked behind it, concealing a proliferation of notes taken
from what he considered data of mostly dubious utility. Behind his tablet was a
Styrofoam cup, the top of which was stained with brown, caffeinated sludge. The
rest of the table was just glare, its flat surface reflecting light into the
periphery, where it was quickly absorbed into the darkness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark picked up the
distressed Styrofoam cup, walked a pace-and-a-half to the diminutive
coffeemaker that sat on the dresser, and poured himself what was left of the
coffee. He then returned to his computer and double-clicked the next file in
the list. The file opened in a new window, and the cursor blinked patiently in
its upper left-hand corner. The document appeared to be an email copied into a
text file for safe-keeping. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark read the
document. And then he read it again. He allowed himself a faint smile. He
realized immediately it could be a very important clue, something that had the
potential to bring this anguished phase of his life to a quick and bloody end.
Then again, even if the document were exactly what he thought it to be, it
could amount to nothing at all, meaning it might not lead him to the
organization that had obliterated his life, killed his little girl. He studied
the numbers, the phrasing. He tried to focus and think, but he realized he was
just too tired. He felt a mixture of hope, anguish, excitement, and unmitigated
pain all at once. He wanted to continue on, but exhaustion flooded his body,
tugged at him like a lead weight. He thought about pressing on anyway, but
decided against it. No sense in starting work he'd have to do over again.
Fatigue causes errors. Better to put what little energy he had left to some
other use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So instead of working
his find, he turned to the thoughtless machinations of copying the important
files ferreted from the previous day's search to an external storage device: a
heavy duty, encrypted, password-protected thumb drive. He then adjusted the
parameters of his search utility to focus on a systematic exploration of
images. He always let this part of his forensic interrogation of storage media
run overnight while he rested. The prodigious amount of porn kept by pedophiles
required the protracted search time. Just locating it all and organizing it
sometimes took hours. What took hours more, though, was the way he searched the
files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All files on
computers contain something called <i>metadata</i>. Metadata is typically not
visible within the file in which it's contained, and its sole purpose is to
convey information about its parent document. Metadata, for instance, can hold
information such as origination date, original author, caption, description,
version, and, in the case of images, a thumbnail. A thumbnail is a very small,
low resolution version of the image in which it resides. They're utilized
mostly as a view option within folders, allowing users to select images by
recognition rather than by name. But a thumbnail does not have to be
representative of its parent file. In fact, it can be any image at all. Open a
folder, double click a thumbnail image of the San Francisco Bridge, get the
Brooklyn Bridge instead. There's lots of software out there that can manage
that. Swapping out thumbnail images on pornographic files is part of a
well-prepared pedophile's arsenal for keeping snooping eyes out of a
highly-prized stash. In his experience, Clark had learned thumbnail masking was
effective at deflecting the untrained eye, but fell way short guarding against
forensic scrutiny. His image searches, therefore, were always sorted by thumbnail
and general metadata content. Typically, pedophiles aren't too creative when
they use thumbnail masking. In fact, he'd found most of his targets had used a
single low resolution image to mask all of their porn, most likely to allow
them to find it more easily. Further, because metadata in general is mostly
invisible, Clark included the more salacious verbiage he formerly eschewed as
parameters for his image search. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark set the search in
motion, drained the rest of his coffee, then collapsed onto his bed. He would
start working the important information in the morning. At the moment, all he
could really think of was sleep. </p>
