<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The meeting had gone
long into the night. In fact, the collaboration had begun on a Friday morning
and run into early morning hours of the next day. On its face, the thumb drive
had not added much in the way of helpful evidence that could be leveraged to point
toward Hassenback's assailant. What it did hold was a collection of favorite
images of pre-teen pornography that probably numbered in the thousands. 
Unfortunately, the collection did not include any images of Hassenback's
victims, just nameless sufferers of brutal crimes, innocence hijacked in the
name of perverted pleasure. While Tobias realized there could never be anything
positive to say about a collection of images such as those stored on the thumb
drive, he was thankful none of them, at least the ones he saw, were of the
flavor of the video that had burned into his mind that first day at the crime
scene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So, what do you think
about Rathman taking on the search?" Asked Sanchez as they stepped out of
headquarters, took a left on Spring Street, and headed toward their unmarked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I have no problem with
that at all," Tobias yawned. "Frankly, shops like ours, even the great LAPD
HQ, aren't really cut out for searches like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"How so?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, if we're all in
agreement our guy's local and always has been, that would be a completely
different story. But our profile says otherwise. What we've painted up is a
picture of a guy who's very mobile and who's after information that will
undoubtedly lead him to some personal reckoning down the road. The information
he's collecting certainly doesn't bind him to this locality, so there's a very
high probability that if he's struck before, it wasn't here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right," said Sanchez,
rubbing his face and eyes with his hands. "I must be getting tired. We're not really
equipped to do global searches that cast a net over the entire country. The FBI
seems to live for that sort of stuff, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Correct." Tobias
glanced at Sanchez sideways, shaking his head slightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?" Asked
Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Promise me
something, kid,&quot; he said, a little irritation spilling into his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sure, anything,"
answered Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"The next time you
put your two cents on a table seated with people who outrank the both of us,
make sure it's not stained with your personal philosophy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, sorry about
that. I was just getting a little frustrated with Rathman. He's so
patronizing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Understood, but
just the same," said Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, okay, I
promise." Sanchez stayed quiet for a moment, then changed the subject.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So Rathman's
definitely going to begin with the most specific profile, first?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yep. And if he gets
any hits, he'll focus on contacting major law enforcement agencies in those
areas." Tobias thumbed a button on key fob for his city-issued Ford Taurus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You drive," he said,
tossing Sanchez the keys. Sanchez moved over to the driver's side door, stepped
in, pressed the keys into the ignition, and started the car. Tobias was in the
middle of belting himself in when his phone rang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tobias,&quot; he
barked into the phone. He went quiet for a moment, listening to the caller,
pantomimed with his hands as he grunted, nodded, and added a few affirmatives.
After a few more moments, he gave the obligatory <i>goodbye</i>, slapped his
phone shut, noticed they had not moved at all, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Are we eventually
going to leave?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez let out a
slightly embarrassed chuckle, put the car in drive and pulled away from the
curb. "Who was that?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Kabinski. He just
wanted to tell us he thinks we did some really good work in there today, told
me not to worry too much about Rathman, that he could be a real self-absorbed
ass at times. Not that I was overly worried about that in the first place."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said nothing,
just continued to engage the heavy LA traffic; even at 2 AM, it was
bumper-to-bumper in some places. Tobias watched him, got a kick out of the fact
the kid still got a little nervous when he had him drive. He continued,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He also said he'd like
to offer his services in reading over the documents we collected from the thumb
drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There weren't a lot of
those, though,&quot; Sanchez offered, keeping his eyes fixed forward and his
hands in the ten-two position on the steering wheel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Nope. But never
underestimate the value of a shrink. Those guys can think of angles people like
you and I couldn't come up with in a million years. Mostly, though, I think
this is going to be interpretation and puzzle solving, and I'm pretty good with
that kind of stuff."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Anything I can help
out with?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias noticed Sanchez
was calming down a bit, or perhaps he was just too tired to be nervous. "Just
keep doing what you've been doing: focus on eliminating the locals as suspects.
How many have you gotten to?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Two," answered
Sanchez. "Hassenback had three convictions, so I only have one family left. I
figured I'd go out there tomorrow and conduct a quick interview with the final
lucky family. It doesn't look promising, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why not?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well the lead who took
information during the initial complaint was very thorough, even indicated the
height and weight of the boyfriend. It wasn't even close,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where's the father?"
Asked Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Deceased. He had the
dubious distinction of being one of the first KIA's in Desert Storm." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked at
Sanchez. He didn't show it, but he knew he was upset about that fact, having
lost a brother to the same senseless war. Perhaps that was why he wanted to
actually pay this family a visit rather than just conduct a phone interview.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Christ," Tobias said,
"Husband down and a child the victim of a sexual predator. Nice world we live
in." They were both quiet for a moment, and then Tobias remembered,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, don't you have
tomorrow off?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're kidding, right?
With a detective like you riding my ass all the time? I never have any days
off!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias laughed, said,
"where are they located?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"About four miles south
of Hassenback's former residence," he replied, irritation clinging to each
word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias could see the
visit might get a little emotional for Sanchez. He was a good kid, but
sometimes he wore his feelings on his sleeve. A lot of young guys on the force
did that. Hell, a lot of veterans had trouble with it. He figured Sanchez could
handle it, but flipped a coin in his head anyway, choosing tails. The coin
whirled and bounced and landed to show a face he knew wasn't very random. The
choice made, he said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why don't you swing by
and pick me up tomorrow before you go out? I'd like to tag along. What time are
you planning on leaving?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Early afternoon,"
Sanchez replied, relief clearly in his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The rest of the drive
was uneventful and quiet. Sanchez managed the freeways of the greater metro
area like a seasoned pro, his driving markedly improving as the traffic
thinned. He parked the Taurus in the station lot, they both exited. Tobias told
Sanchez to pick him up at his house at one in the afternoon the next day, and
they went their separate ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>An hour later, Tobias
sat alone in the kitchen of this home. Carol was upstairs sleeping, but he
wasn't tired. He made himself a quick cup of instant decaf, pepped it up with a
dab of brandy, and sat at the table Carol had purchased from a garage sale ten
years earlier. It was a sturdy piece of craftsmanship: its rounded surface
sported a dull pine finish and sat atop four hand-carved wooden legs painted
white. The table seated four adults comfortably and fit perfectly in the
kitchen nook, a convenient place for serving a quick meal when they were both
in a hurry, which they usually were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He set his coffee
cup on the table, next to the printed copies of all ten documents retrieved
from the thumb drive. Nine of the copies had nothing more than email addresses
on them, affixed just above or below short correspondences, some of which
included references to web sites. Two of the web sites were simply IP
addresses, no domain name attached to them at all. It was just the kind of
correspondence you'd expect between pedophiles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The remaining
document, though, stood out. On its surface, it had nothing to do with
pornography at all. It appeared to be a marketing piece from a bank. Tobias
thought about that. Why would a couple of pedophiles be interested in sharing
information about investment opportunities? He took another swig of his
turbo-charged coffee, felt the warm and welcome effect of the brandy. He
started scrutinizing the marketing piece but caught himself reading the same
line several times as he started to doze. After another couple of unsuccessful
attempts to read it over, he succumbed and decided its review could wait until
the morning. It'd still be there. He yawned and returned the documents to his
briefcase, then took out his PDA and typed in a personal reminder to continue
with the marketing document when he had the time. Perhaps in the car on the way
to the interview with Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dean Gerkowitcz stood
in his front yard. It was Saturday, which was typically a day off for him.
Since losing his job, though, the days had begun to blend together. He smiled
bitterly as he realized losing track of time was probably a reality victims of
corporate whimsy had to get used to. He didn't like his days blending together,
didn't like loose schedules. He was most comfortable working out of a calendar,
keeping precise control over his daily activities, accounting for every minute
he spent on whatever projects he worked on. That's how he'd always been. He was
a hard worker, too, had always put in his time. Because of his work ethic, he'd
made the various banks he'd worked for over the years hundreds of millions of
dollars, probably billions. And after more than a decade of busting his ass in
the corporate world, he finally got noticed by a major L.A. bank. He was
offered and accepted a position within the bank's investment division, and he
moved his family to Southern California. That was six years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>During those
years, Dean had served the bank well, putting in long hours and keeping up with
the newer trends in investment practices. When the opportunity to buy up
subprime mortgages came along, he'd spent a lot of time trying to explain to
his bosses that investing in that corner of the market presented opportunity
that vastly outweighed the risk. In spite of the rose-colored picture he
painted for them, though, he knew better. He knew there would be rampant
speculation, housing inflation, and a resultant enormous bubble. The only
reasonable end for such a system would be a collapse of the housing market
brought on by foreclosures, the ripple effect being perhaps a global recession,
probably a short one. He didn't care about any of that, though. What he did
care about was managing the bank's exposed risk by selling off all of the toxic
assets before the bottom fell out. And, of course, the bottom <i>would</i> fall
out. How could it not? But if you played the game right, watched the market,
and got out in a timely fashion, a whole shitload of money could be made. The
whole game was to <i>not</i> be left holding any bad mortgages when the part
was over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But his bank decided
something didn't smell right, so a <i>junior</i> executive, some peon director
with a hard-on for the CEO, had been tasked to review the investments he'd had
cultivated so carefully. And this punk comes in, sees something he doesn't
like, and blows the whistle, pulled the stop on the whole fucking system. Of
course, he'd not had the opportunity to move the mortgages, and as a result the
bank lost a shitload of money. He'd tried to explain to the CFO how they still
might be able to come out of the crisis swimming in cash, but he received
nothing but some stupidity about morals and economic fallout as a response. In
the end, he'd found it necessary to secure counsel and threaten to sue the bank
if it terminated his employment. After a few months of haggling, he'd been
offered a 15 million dollar severance package, effective two months hence. In the
meantime, he was suspended with pay. He was satisfied with the severance, but
he'd never think of himself as anything other than a victim when it came to
what the bank had done to him. How could he not? What gave them the right to do
what they did? He was doing his job, and he had a family to feed, damn it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So there he was,
standing in his front yard, watching his six year-old daughter, Samantha, play
with the family mutt, a black ball of hair supposedly bred in England during
the last century to help control that country's out-of-control rat population.
As he looked at her, he could think of nothing in the world he loved more. She
was his life, unlike that lazy bitch mother of hers who was still probably
lounging around in bed.  He continued to tolerate her because she was good with
his daughter, but he'd lost interest in her just after Samantha was born, when
she refused to take off the fucking weight. Now how was he supposed to stay
interested in a fat pig like that? When she'd finally ballooned up to 230
pounds, he'd had enough. Since then, it had been separate bedrooms and a
passing nod in the hallways. As far as he was concerned, so long as she
remained a positive influence in his daughter's life and continued to put food
on the table when he wanted it, she'd be okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Samantha!" He called.
He watched as his daughter squealed and ran, the little black ball of fur
chasing her and nipping at her heels along the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Daddy!" She yelled as
she ran up to him. He bent down, lifted her off the ground in a flurry of
giggles. He hefted her weight as if she were a feather. She looked tiny nestled
in his arms. At six foot two and 255 pounds, he was fairly proud of his
physique. Sure, he had a pot belly, but what of it? He was the bread-winner in
the family, for Christ's sake. He didn't have time to go to the gym, unlike
that cow back in the house. He pressed Samantha closer to him, and she reached
out and gave his bushy moustache a gentle tug, wrapping its length around a
tiny fist as she did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why you hafta go,
dada? Can someone else do you work?" She asked, pouting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, sweetie. I'm
sorry, but no one else can." He never enjoyed leaving on the weekends. Truth be
told, he'd much rather spend the day with Samantha. He looked down at her,
watched her as she cast her please-don't-go-daddy eyes at him and curled her
little lower lip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tell you what," he
said, "When I get back, we'll go to your favorite store and buy you whatever
you want, okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She smiled at the
thought, probably figured it was a decent trade, and let him return her to the
ground without a fuss. He bent over, gave her a kiss on the forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Bye, dada! See you
a-morrow!" She squealed and sprinted around the corner of the house and into
the back yard, the little dog bouncing behind her every step of the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dean pulled out the
keys to his BMW X3, a comfortable little SUV he'd paid cash for a couple of
years before. He unlocked the driver's side door, started it up, and backed out
of his driveway. As he headed down the street, he thought about what lay ahead,
thought it was probably going to be a very long day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then his mind
drifted back to his termination. It had been an insult to his intelligence, had
caused him a tremendous amount of psychological pain and suffering.  He thought
about the fallout caused by the subprime mortgage mess, about all those who'd
lost or would soon lose their homes to foreclosure. They were the lucky ones,
really. Weren't they? After all, they had less distance to fall. How bad could
it be to simply lose a house that wasn't worth any more than the car he was now
driving? He wondered what all the fuss was about. None of them had suffered as
he had. None of them had been victimized as he had. And now he had to scramble
to protect his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And then he
thought of the desert and the opportunity that lay there.  After five years of
slowly growing his operation near Riverside, he could finally make a serious
investment in it, in both time and money. He could grow that interest and turn
a profit that would more than make up for his lost salary. And that was the
difference between him and those whiny little fucking bastards that were losing
their homes, right? When in a crisis, improvise for Christ's sake!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He continued down the
road lost in triumphant thought, unaware of the older model Jaguar sedan that
had crept along behind him and parked just across the street from his house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark rolled out of bed
at 8:15 AM Saturday morning, alone. He vaguely remembered losing it the night
before. Carri had consoled him, held him deep into the night. He couldn't
remember when she'd left, but he was sure she'd snuck out to avoid any
awkwardness between them in the morning. He felt a mixture of embarrassment for
losing control of himself emotionally and gratitude she'd been there to help
him through it. He stood and stretched, hands raised above him high enough to
palm the low ceiling of the weekly. He stumbled to the tiny sludge machine on
the dresser and set it to make its maximum four cups of morning brew. As the
machine chortled and the coffee dripped, he looked over to the table, saw Carri
had not taken the grocery bags on her way out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He walked over and
rummaged through the two bags: bread, coffee, a few cans of beef stew, bananas,
several protein bars, sports drinks, and a six pack of premium beer. He was
genuinely moved by how much she cared. After all, he was simply a stranger to
her. But wasn't that what she'd been to him when he'd come to her aid while she
was being attacked by her psycho ex-husband? Perhaps this made them even. Clark
didn't really believe that, though. What she'd done the previous evening, in
his mind anyway, didn't even compare to what he did for her. She'd given
herself to him, supported him, had been thoughtful beyond what he figured a
normal, even caring, person could be. There was something more there, too. He
knew it, she knew it, and he couldn't let it go any further. There was just no
sense in it. He was more than likely on a one-way express trip to Hell, and that
was not a journey he was willing to share with a person who had no stake in
what he was doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark returned to the
coffee machine, which had just completed belching out the last of its filmy,
black sludge. He poured himself a cup and returned to the table. He sat, opened
his laptop, fired it up, and double-clicked the folder containing Hassenback's
email.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All of it was held
in one big file with a .<i>dbx</i> extension, which meant Hassenback used
Microsoft Outlook Express to manage at least some of his correspondences. From
the perspective of a sexual predator, that was smart, but Clark had learned it
was also pretty standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Most casual users
employ web-based email applications. Using the internet to manage email is
convenient, but it's not very secure. That's because all of the correspondence
associated with the application stays on the server, probably in-perpetuity.
When a mail message is retrieved by the browser, its content is simply
presented as web page. The closest it gets to making a permanent home on the
client machine is in a system folder that stores temporary internet files. The
original stays on the server, even after it's deleted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Because of the way
email is stored in these kinds of systems, those who choose to use them must be
very careful about what they say. The reason for this is simple: the law states
any correspondence saved on a mail server can be subpoenaed and any information
gathered from them can be used as evidence in civil and criminal courts. The
fact that Hassenback used Outlook Express told Clark he was savvy enough to be
aware of that. Further, if he was smart enough to use a client like Outlook
Express to manage his email, then he was certainly smart enough to choose a
mail server that would immediately remove any stored emails once he downloaded
them to his computer. The simple conclusion, then, was that all of the emails
in the .<i>dbx</i> file more than likely represented all but the very latest of
Hassenback's electronic correspondence. The benefit there being that Clark
wouldn't have to spend too much time pinging Hassenback's email server for his
most recent, unread exchanges. The less poking around he did, the less risky
the whole endeavor became.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While Clark had all of
Hassenback's emails, and even had all of his programs, he couldn't just fire up
Hassenback's copy of Outlook Express and start rifling through his
correspondence: one, Outlook Express wasn't installed on his machine; two, even
if it were, he'd still have to import the .<i>dbx</i> file to gain access to
the emails; and, three, to browse the messages contained within the file, he'd
have to recover Hassenback's password. Instead of suffering through that kind
of inconvenience, Clark launched a program called EMDT, an acronym for Email
Discovery Tool. EMDT can open correspondence generated from various types of
email systems, removing the need for having to install every email client under
the sun just to explore all of the individual types. With the software loaded,
Clark attached the .<i>dbx</i> file, and all of Hassenback's emails displayed
in front of him. No need for a password.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was only
interested in emails from Eduardo, so he sorted the list in the inbox by name
and browsed through them until he found the mostly likely candidate address: PimpEd@secureEService.com.
There were about 20 correspondences, so he randomly opened one of them. It was
short, communicating a single line of text suggesting Hassenback check out a
site, followed by a link containing an IP address. It was signed <i>Eduardo</i>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Confident he found
the right guy, Clark opened the sent folder, sorted that list, and looked for
all outgoing messages to PimpEd. There were about 40, half of which were
replies. Clark highlighted all of the emails and printed them. While he waited
for his dinky, portable inkjet printer to complete the job, he grabbed a
protein bar and a banana from one of the grocery bags Carri had left and had
himself a makeshift breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Once the documents were
printed, Clark poured himself another cup of coffee, sat back down in front of
his machine, and opened a blank text file. He spent the next few hours reading
and re-reading all of the correspondences, taking notes as he did. He didn't
really care about what they said as opposed to <i>how</i> they were written.
Without exception, all of Hassenback's emails were littered with spelling and
usage errors that were tucked sloppily into short, choppy sentences and
fragments. That was the bad news. The good news was he was consistent with his
errors. When he felt he'd gained enough working knowledge to spoof an email by
Hassenback, he composed a message to Eduardo:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Intrested in banking op. Those
there real rates? Wanna meet ASAP. Let me no when you have time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>
