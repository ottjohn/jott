<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Clickity clack,
clack, clack! Snap, snap! Clickity clack, clack!</i> Tobias busied himself
entering notes into his PDA, notes he felt warranted further scrutiny than a
single meeting could provide, notwithstanding its almost intolerable length. He
turned, faced the whiteboard he used to sketch out the partial profile of Hassenback's
assailant, and snapped a couple of pictures. He hammered in a few more notes
and then turned to Sanchez, who was sitting in the same chair he'd occupied for
the entire duration of the meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It would appear
LAPD HQ has a different take on the meaning of an hour than we do, what do you
think?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave him a
droopy nod, said, "Yep. Most definitely more than sixty minutes anyway. So
what's next?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, I suppose
we're going to continue with the profiling piece; then I'm hoping we'll move on
to the contents of the thumb drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So what's all
this business with breaking the profiling into three pieces?" He asked. "I
don't get it. Why not just get everything out and be done with it?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's all about
scope and probabilities, kid. We start with what we're confident of first, to
get a good, high probability foundational picture of our perp. And as you could
tell from the discussions we had, there's not a whole lot of agreement among us
about what actually is a certainty with respect to describing the guy we're
after."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez though
about that for a moment, then said, "Well, none of this stuff's for certain
anyway, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, none of it
is,&quot; said Tobias. He rummaged through the bits and pieces he'd remembered
from what he'd read years ago, then said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We break up the
profile into three pieces because there are three classes of assumptions we
formulate when profiling a suspect. The first class has the highest confidence,
the third the lowest. Each class is defined by assumptions that have comparable
accuracies, or probabilities. So, for example, in our first class, we have to
be highly confident of each of the assumptions we make about the suspect; in
the third class, the confidence of the assumptions diminish."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay," said
Sanchez, "then why do the probabilities diminish? It seems to me that as we
build out our description of our suspect, the probability we're correct and
therefore going to find him should increase as well, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Not necessarily,
but that is a common misconception. Consider this example: let's say we start
with a profile of a suspect that simply states the assailant is a man. In that
case, the probability we're correct in our assumption is very high, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, I mean,
women engage in this type of crime, but it's rare." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right. But even
though our simple profile has an extremely high probability of being correct,
it's not very helpful. A profile like that narrows the scope of the search to
probably three million men in the LA area. Now let's add to our assumption
list. Let's assume our assailant is six foot four and 240 pounds. We now have a
more useful profile, but what do you think that does to its accuracy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's going to
diminish it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're right.
Why?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked up
to the ceiling, rubbed the stubble on his chin and thought for a moment. "Okay,
I'll use that damn statistics class you made me take last year to illustrate:
if I flip a single coin, the probability it will land on heads is fifty
percent, same for tails. So if we're asked to guess the outcome of a single
flip of a coin, we'll be fifty percent certain it'll  be heads. This is kind of
like the first assumption we applied to the suspect, that the sex is male.
Having only this attribute gives us very high confidence that we're right. But
it doesn't help us much."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded;
Sanchez continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Now, if I decide
to flip two coins, and I'm asked to guess the outcome of both flips, then I'll
be twenty five percent sure both will wind up being heads."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why's that?"
Asked Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked up
at the ceiling again, reached back in his mind, looked at Tobias, satisfied
with what he found. "Because there're only four outcomes for such a scenario:
tails-tails, tails-heads, heads-tails, and heads-heads. Each of those events
has the same probability of occurring, and if we're looking for the heads-heads
outcome, the probability is one in four. So to extend the analogy, when we add
an attribute to the suspect's profile, we have a more accurate picture of him,
but the probability our model is correct has to diminish."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded,
then said, "In a purely random world, yes. But we're also talking about
categorical probability distributions, and while the probability seems small,
compared to another category based on a different set of descriptions, it's
actually relatively high.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said,
&quot;So compared to the category that contains nothing but midgets with club
feet, our category is most likely the correct one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias nodded,
said, &quot;Yes. We're looking for the most likely category of potential
offenders. That's the simplest and least useful explanation of profiling you're
going to get. It's simply the application of statistical and psychological
analysis to a crime to shed light on an unknown perp. It's far from a perfect
science, but sometimes the margin of error can be staggeringly small."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez paused,
appeared to be deep in thought, then said, "So there's another reason for
keeping the three classes of assumptions separate, right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yep. And you're
going to tell me what that is."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"My guess is so we
have three different sets of search criteria, working from the most specific to
the least. That way, if we miss our suspect with our most specific search, we
can fall back on the middle class and leverage it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Just as Tobias was
going to give Sanchez another thumbs up, Jacobsen and Kabinski walked back in
the meeting room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As everyone
settled in, Jacobsen leaned over the table and pressed a green button on the
console in front of him to activate the camera, and just that quickly the
agreeable Agent Rathman was back in the room as well. Jacobsen then removed a
black marker from his briefcase, threw it to Kabinski, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Your turn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski smiled,
got up from his chair, his slacks showing no sign of wrinkles or creases that
would indicate he'd been wearing them for the last ten hours. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay,&quot; he
said, "I think we've made a very good start." He rested his fingertips on the
table, looked around the room, and then continued. "While we were at dinner, I
tossed some ideas at Jacobsen here, and I think we came up with some
assumptions that might help us to quickly flesh out the final part of our
suspect profile. Any objections to me going over those first?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The room remained
silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good. Well, I've
been thinking about our assumption the assailant is completely on his own. I
agree with that assessment, but I also think there's more to it, and I think
the crime scene bears that out. Specifically, it could be a primary driver in
his behavior. We already know the assailant is highly organized and smart.
Obviously, the nature of the crime and our surrounding assumptions regarding
his motives means he once had a family."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He has no family
now," said Tobias. "What you're getting at is this guy really is <i>alone in
the world</i>, which means there are no survivors at all, nothing left to keep
him grounded in the present so he can plan for the future."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabiniski regarded
Tobias with a smile, said. "you've been thinking about this too. Yes, based on
the nature of the attack on Hassenback, I think we can conclude either the wife
is deceased, along with any other family members who matter, or she left him,
completely disappearing from his life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Very good, gentleman,"
said Rathman. "Such a condition would free up any uncertainty about his
actions, no counter-balance to his need for revenge. An otherwise lucid man
would still have doubts about taking such action, would care about what
surviving family members would think of what he's doing. Without any survivors,
though, he's free of those constraints. In other words, he's got nothing to
lose and no one to disappoint."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski nodded his
head in agreement, then said, "In this case, I'm leaning toward a deceased
spouse. If she were alive, I think the scene would've had more contamination,
formed more out of aggression than the surgical strike it was."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman nodded his head
aggressively, betraying an enthusiasm that showed he was definitely now in his
element. He continued,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right. There was only
one indication he lost his cool at the scene, that being the body of Hassenback
itself. As you pointed out, his remaining activities reflected a methodical
purpose that was definitely lacking the spillover rage that would have more
than likely been evident had this crime been driven partially as an effort to
send a message to his wife."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, so we have
agreement about this point?" Kabinski asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There were nods of
agreement all around the table and on the wall. Kabinski turned and wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Wife deceased. Singularity
a driver in activity. Nothing to lose.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman looked into the
room like animated wall art, carrying a demeanor of a person who was just
bursting to talk. He pressed a meaty finger onto the center of his glasses to
push them back up his nose and said, "Okay, so what else you got, Kabinski?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Smart guy. Family man.
Smart family men are generally fairly successful. Fairly successful family men
typically have houses. I think we can assume, then, that our man was a
homeowner. The big question, though, is does his still <i>own</i> his house? I
think we get much better than even odds this guy sold his house and is now
using the equity to finance his mission."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I keep hearing the
word <i>mission</i>," scoffed Rathman. "You people are making it sound as
though this guy is conducting some king of renegade military operation!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave the wall a
look of irritation, then said, "It fits the criteria, Rathman. This guy has a
strategy: he plans, he executes, and he will <i>continue</i> to cycle through
planning and executing until he gets what he's after. Hell, he's even leaving a
wake of collateral damage, though some might argue that to be more of a public
service."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Everyone at the table
stared at Sanchez, Tobias in particular giving him a disappointed shake of his
head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What? Can't a lowly
sergeant have an opinion?" Sanchez blurted, then said, "Look, I didn't really
mean the public service thing. I'm sure repeat offender pedophiles have every
right to live productive "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What Kabinski said
makes sense," interrupted Tobias, returning the conversation to a more
productive peal while preventing Sanchez from digging a hole he wouldn't be
able to get out of. "If he's engaged in serial activity to collect information,
then that activity could take him all over the country, perhaps even the world.
Someone that dedicated to a <i>mission</i> isn't going to have time to work,
and he's going to need money from somewhere. Equity cashed out of a house is a
really good way to bankroll something like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski nodded,
continued. "The next obvious question, then, is how he's spending his money.
He's already demonstrated his skill for not contaminating crime scenes, so it
probably makes sense he's not going to leave a money trail, either. I highly
doubt, then, he's living a life of luxury on the road, staying in high-end
hotels. My bet is he's staying in very cheap motels, the types that take cash
and don't ask questions. My bet is our suspect probably operates exclusively on
a cash-only basis."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski again
looked around the room, then said, "So do we have any objections to adding the
assumption this guy has money but only spends cash?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Again, there were
no objections, so again Kabinski turned to the board and wrote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Has money. Works
with cash only. Stays in inexpensive motels. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's about all
Jacobsen and I got to over dinner," said Kabinski. "Anyone got anything else to
add?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I have a bit more," offered
Rathman. "Let's talk about the intelligence factor a little more, because I
think it might uncover other things. For instance, highly organized persons who
commit violent crimes, especially those who are as efficient as our guy, tend
to have some education. I would bet our guy has at least a four year degree. In
fact, I would bet his degree is in a hard science."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman peered into the
room, said, "Any problem with that assessment? It builds into something else."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>No reply, just nods all
around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"To use the word
we've been bandying about," Continued Rathman, his image appearing to look
directly at Sanchez, "this appears to be a very <i>mission</i>-driven man. This
isn't an attribute that spilled out of him overnight. I would suggest our perp
was a head-to-book sort of guy when he was younger, mission driven all the way
through college. I think it's probably a characteristic he's carried around
with him for his whole life. He probably hangs on to things like a Pit Bull. In
fact, I'd bet he spent the first couple of years after college focusing on
getting a good job, then perhaps even another couple of years more to acclimate
to it. Only after that would a guy like this even consider injecting himself
into the social scene to find a good woman, get married, have kids, yada, yada.
Given he's a meticulous guy, though, I would also wager he waited at least a
couple of years to have his first and only child. Now, taking into
consideration the average age range for victims of sexual crimes is between
four and 12 years old, I think we can safely assume the guy we're looking for
was somewhere between the ages of  32 and 40 at the time of his child's
abduction.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman paused,
presumably to allow everyone else to catch up with his slick thinking, then
continued. &quot;This is all very shaky, and there's one more likely scenario
to add to the confusion: there's also a good chance the guy we're after did a
stint in the military, four years, honorable discharge. Therefore, the likely
age of our suspect could be somewhere in the neighborhood of forty-four years
old."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman looked
around the room, appeared content his synopsis had topped of the profile of the
perp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Bump it up at
least a year," said sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And why's that?"
Asked Rathman, his face suddenly appearing large and flushed on the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Stands to
reason," answered Sanchez. "The wife more than likely didn't die on the day of
the abduction, and he's not going to engage in his mission on the day of her
death. He needs a cooling off period. To say otherwise would contradict much of
what we've already assumed about him. To strike right after these events would
demand he be driven by rage, and this was not the case. Bump it up at least a
year to accommodate for the deceased wife and the cooling off period."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave
Sanchez a nod and a look that conveyed the message he'd made up for his earlier
transgression. Kabinski verbalized what Tobias seemed to be silently
communicating,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Damn good
observation, Sanchez." He then went to the board and wrote, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>College educated. Probably
Hard science. Probable stint in the military. Age between 33 and 45.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm not done,&quot;
said Rathman, a note of irritation still ringing in his voice. "Let's go back
to the size of this fellow. He's a big guy, right? And he's definitely on the
road a lot. He spends a whole lot of time in his vehicle. Big guy like that's
not going to be comfortable in a small or even medium-sized car. In fact, I
would bet he uses his vehicle as his base of operations occasionally, so he
needs something that will accommodate him, give him some room. Given his size
and his road-based activities, I would put him in either a large SUV or a
truck. Further, it'll be a very low-key vehicle. If he's a smart guy, he's not
going to want a lot of attention, so my money's on a vehicle that's at least
six or seven years old. Nothing fancy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good point," said
Kabinski. There appeared to be no argument, so he went to the board and wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Owns an SUV or a
truck. At least six or seven years old.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski turned back
toward the camera that fed his image to Rathman, asked, "are you done now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"If I had a couple of
days, I could come up with more I'm sure. But for now, that's about all I
got,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tobias?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked around
the table and said, "everybody's so cooperative this evening. What's going on?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I think we're all a
bit tired," offered Jacobsen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Everyone turned to
look at the lieutenant, as if each was contemplating what sort of brain
processing went behind a decision to answer a rhetorical question. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, I'll make this
quick," said Tobias. "There's only one more thing I can think of: he went out
of his way to take the media. This tells me he knows what to do with it. I'm
certainly no expert in this, but I get the feeling if a guy takes storage media
for the purpose of interrogation, then he has to be at the very least connected
to an IT field in some way. This just isn't something your average schmuck is
capable of. I'm not sure what his degree was in, but I'm pretty confident we'll
find he actually works in the field in some capacity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman arched his
eyebrows, his glasses using the opportunity to once again slip down his nose.
"Very good, Detective. Write that one up on the board, Kabinski."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski turned and
wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Connected to the IT
field.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I think that's
probably good enough to start a three-level search," said Rathman. "What do we
have left?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jacobsen motioned
Kabinski to take his seat, leaned over the side of his chair, picked up manila
envelope, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We have some relevant
material from the thumb drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Everyone groaned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stormed into his
sleazy weekly, turned to close and lock the door, then faced the table on which
he'd left his laptop. He'd left the restaurant overcome by a mixture of sorrow
and rage. By the time he'd reached the motel, most of that was replaced by
regret over the abruptness of his departure. At the beginning of the hour, all
he'd wanted was to get away, to get back to work. But as Carri continued to
talk, to share her ideas and perspectives, she started to transform from some
stranger for whom he'd done a favor, to a very pretty, smart woman who was
beginning to reel him into her world. He thought her passion was remarkable,
and she had, throughout the entire hour, made him feel as though he was the
only person in her world. Carri deserved better than the exit he gave her, for
sure. He would have to find a way to make it up to her somehow. But his
departure was unavoidable, no way he could have changed that. She took out that
damn credit card, and embossed on its surface was a family-friendly image of a
teddy bear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It looked a lot like
the one he'd given his daughter years earlier. That by itself would have been
enough to peel back the scab that had barely begun to form around the wound of
an obliterated family. But he could have endured that. He could have swallowed
it whole and made an impression of a friendly goodbye, a final
nice-to-have-met-you he knew Carri deserved. The image, however, had caused
some synapses in his brain to fire, to reach for associations and build context
around what he saw; and as the branching electrochemical circuitry went to
work, it quickly assembled three things in his mind: daughter's teddy bear,
family-oriented images, and bulleted list. The strength and relevance of the
association was so shockingly powerful, it was as if Clark had been cold-cocked
right there in the restaurant by Mike Tyson himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark sat at the
table, flipped open his laptop, and fired it up. He launched his web browser
and loaded the website he'd been looking at only a couple of hours earlier. He
quickly scanned the bottom of the page, noticed there were only two teddy bears
bulleting its various marketing points. The bear he was looking for was in the
first column, second row. He right-clicked on the image and saved it to a
working folder, then opened it up with a free Microsoft imaging software
package and enlarged it to 400% of its original size. A grossly pixilated image
stared back at him, nothing more than a blurry presentation of colored squares.
He scrutinized every detail: the left eye appeared to have a shadow underneath
it, betraying damage done by a feisty little terrier. The right breast
expressed a blurry yellow ribbon, put there by a deceased aunt who had lost her
only son in Iraq. The neck presented a barely perceptible, thin gold chain. Below
it dangled a small, red heart. The necklace had been put there by a loving
father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He continued to
stare at the image, once again overcome by the mixture of anger and sorrow that
had assaulted him in the restaurant. His emotional state now, however, was seasoned
with a prodigious amount of disbelief and the kind of satisfaction that can
only be delivered by pure dumb luck. Or was it luck? For the past couple of
years, he'd had worked tirelessly searching for a vector, a direction toward
resolution. Until now, he hadn't had much relief. He could always find a
direction, but it was always just a bit off, taking him on unproductive
tangents until he found himself circling around to try again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But this was
different. He allowed himself the briefest of smiles. This was <i>different</i>.
What he'd found, beyond any shadow of doubt, would provide him with a true
direction, the vector he'd been looking for. There could be no other
conclusion: the left eye of the teddy bear had been partially torn off by the
family dog, a terrier named Baxter; the aunt who had placed the yellow ribbon
on its right breast was his dead wife's sister; and he'd placed the necklace
around the bear's neck himself. Any one of observations alone would have given
him pause, would have brought up doubt about the veracity of the find. But
together, the probability he was wrong was staggeringly small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark closed his
browser window, closed the image of the teddy bear he'd given to his daughter
years before, its grossly pixilated image disappearing from his sight but not
from his mind. He shut down his machine and closed the lid. He felt sick. The
light from the lone incandescent bulb that hung above him cast its meager
brightness over the table, which dutifully reflected most of it back as a hazy
glare that seemed to dig into his head and press against the back of his eyes.
Besides the little cocoon of light and glare in which he was working, the room
held no other illumination. It was as if the environment surrounding him was
really the gaping maw of a hungry black hole, greedily devouring any light that
dared moved too close to its well-defined boundary. His head throbbed. He got
up from his rickety chair, took the three steps to the dresser, found pain
relief in a bottle, and took three. Headache or no, he had work to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He stepped to a
white mini-fridge parked on the floor next to the dresser, positioned to double
as makeshift counter space. He opened it and removed a bottle of beer. He
twisted off its top, took another three steps to the room's ratty bed, propped
up his pillows, and sat down with his legs outstretched in front of him. He had
no problem sleeping under or on top of sheets that had been washed and then
used by an almost countless number of strangers. Pillows, on the other hand,
were an entirely different matter to him: too many holes in the human head out
of which fluid could drip or secrete, and a pillow soiled and polluted by
strangers was the last thing he wanted to lay his head on at night. So the
pillows were his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took a swig
of beer; it spilled pleasantly into his mostly empty stomach. Then he stared at
the ceiling, trying to banish the image of the bear, attempting to focus on his
next best steps. The combination of the alcohol and the pain reliever were
beginning to take effect; his head was no longer throbbing. But the bear
persisted. Whoever had built the site had been smart. But not smart enough.
Whoever had built the site had decided it would be clever to incorporate
thumbnail images of trophies taken from their young victims into their
confabulated marketing piece, a little shared secret for their members to
marvel over, a list they could aspire to contribute to. Whoever had built the
site knew the odds of anyone surfing to it and recognizing any of the
thumbnails were small to say the least, infinitesimal even. After all, the site
had no domain name, so how could anyone just <i>accidentally</i> surf to it?
Clark lifted his beer to his lips and took a long pull. The alcohol washed
through his system, gave him the feeling of happy isolation and heightened
focus. Time to get back to work. As he swung his feet off the bed to head
toward the table, he heard three tentative raps at his door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>An electric shock
of surprise flew through his body, the voltage of which spiked his heart rate
and temporarily made his breathing ragged. His mind raced, millions of thoughts
seemingly racing about all at once, each demanding scrutiny. Clark burst out of
bed, yelled "Just a moment!" He crossed the tiny room to his laptop,
frantically stuffed it and the rest of the paperwork lying on the table into
his briefcase, returned to the bed, and slid it underneath. How could the
police have caught up with him so fast? Who else could it be? He'd told no one
where he was staying, really had no one <i>to</i> tell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he forced
himself to slow down, took control of his heartbeat and breathing. He thought
about it. Even in his pessimistic mind, the odds the police were at his door
were very low: huge city, very little evidence left behind, perhaps a rough
physical description based on the condition of the body. It didn't add up. He
thought a little more, concentrated on the knock. It had been tentative. There
had been no declaration from behind the door that it had in fact been the
police. And the police would not give three soft raps on the door in the first
place, right? More than likely, this was nothing more than a visit from one of
his neighbors or the management. Satisfied he was in no immediate peril, he
stepped to the door, unlocked it, and opened it just a crack, instinctively
placing a foot behind it to keep the visitor out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked through
the opening in the door, a small vertical crack about an inch and a half wide,
saw sparkling azure eyes beam back at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"How ..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Did I find you?" She
finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah,&quot; Clark
stammered. How had she found him? He'd left her at the restaurant over two
hours ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I followed you, Joe!
How else would I know where you live?" The final word was inflected, not
intentionally, with little repugnance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh," Clark answered,
his head awash with that far away feeling from having been caught off guard,
his speech slowed and almost slurred. He looked at her. She smiled. Then he
noticed she had two large paper bags in her arms. The molasses in his head
thinned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Forgive me,&quot; he
said, smiled. "You caught me a bit off guard." That was the understatement of
the century. He'd let his preoccupation, his revelry in shock and anger soak
into him so much he'd not been careful at all on his return trip to the motel.
Dangerous, stupid, and he couldn't let it happen again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Please, Carri, come
in." Clark stepped back and let Carri pass through the door. She walked
directly to the small table and placed both paper bags in a spot that had held
his laptop and some paperwork just a minute before. She then turned to face
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He said, "you shouldn't
have followed me. This isn't exactly a safe neighborhood, you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I .." She paused,
looked down, staring at her feet. Her blue and white dress clung to her body in
all the right places, her hair tousled around her shoulders, her hands crossed
in front of her, fingers interlaced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm <i>so</i>
sorry, Joe,&quot; she looked up, her face now wearing a worn look, her eyes
just beginning to brim with wetness. "You're right. I have no business here, no
right to follow you. I am <i>so</i> sorry for the intrusion, <i>really</i>. I
just " She looked around, taking in the depravity, shocked by it. "The bags on
the table are groceries. They're for you, Joe. Please forgive me." The last
sentence was barely choked out as Carri rushed by Clark and reached for the
door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wait," Clark said
as he grabbed her arm. Carri stopped, said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You bought me <i>groceries</i>?"
He almost laughed out. "Why?" But he already knew the answer. He let go of her
arm, and she turned to face him again, eyes now brimming over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh, Joe, you left
in such a hurry." She used both hands to smooth back her hair, which was
beginning to clutter about her face. "Obviously, something happened at the
restaurant, something went wrong. I had to find out what, so I immediately
hatched a plan to follow you home. About 45 minutes later, you parked here. I
thought you were perhaps visiting someone, but when you didn't come out, I
concluded you lived here." Again the unintentional inflection of disgust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And you figured me
for some displaced soul in need of food and supplies," he deadpanned. She
looked at him, then away, her face flushed with shame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm sorry, Joe!"
The tears began streaming down her face now, leaving delicate paths of purplish
blue. "It's not that I think you're a bum, Joe. You lost everything, though,
didn't you? You lost your job, your possessions, and from the looks of it, your
family too! Oh, Joe, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to make you feel like a
charity case; I was only trying to help!" She looked down again, trying to
choke back sobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark burst out
laughing. He couldn't think of anything else to do. She was so damn close to
the truth! What was his other option? Join her in a tear fest?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri stood back,
let out with a partial laugh choked back by a sob. She raised her right hand
and slapped it on Clark's left shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What's so funny?"
She asked, wiping her eyes with her free hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"In this dark,
cold ocean populated with so many self-centered, uncompassionate creatures, how
the hell did I get so lucky as to meet Mother Teresa herself?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She stifled
another sob and joined in his laughter. "I could say the same thing about you,
Joe!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark cringed at
the name, then made a decision he hoped he wouldn't later regret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Jack," he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"My name, Carri,
isn't Joe. It's Jack. I'm sorry for the lie. But I didn't think it would hurt
at the time because I didn't think I'd ever see you again. And I didn't really
want my real name given in case the police showed up at the Rusty Pelican."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's okay," she
said, removing her hand from his chest and employing it to finish wiping her
face clean. "I completely understand." She averted her eyes slightly,
indicating that perhaps she didn't. She looked around, took in the entire room
for the first time. She looked again at Clark, at his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What happed
tonight? What made you leave so quickly?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark gave the
question a moment's consideration, decided a half-truth couldn't hurt much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"The image on your
credit card, the bear; I gave my daughter a bear a lot like it when she was
four years old." He stopped, aware the memory alone was enough push him toward
a place he didn't want to go. He looked down, averted his eyes from hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh,&quot; she
said. "How long has it been since you've seen her?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Two years,&quot;
he replied. His voice involuntarily cracked, memories began flooding into his
consciousness, taking him back to a time when he was a solid man and not the
jagged, vengeful shell of what he'd once been. He felt himself slipping,
falling into the past. He fought it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Jack?" She asked
softly, taking one of his big paws in both of her hands. "What's her name?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"<i>Was</i>," he
replied slowly, painfully. "What <i>was</i> her name. Jessica. Her name was
Jessica." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Suddenly Clark was
flooded with a memory of the day he'd given his daughter the bear. It had been
Easter, and she was four years old. He and his wife, Stacy, had taken her to
the park for an Easter egg hunt. The weather was cooperative, the sun casting
copious amounts of sunshine into the crisp spring air. The other children at
the hunt, however, seemed to have no notion of fair play. As it turned out,
Jessica was much smaller than all of the other kids. She had scrambled toward
the obvious eggs cast about all over the park, but, each time, before she could
get to them, a larger, faster child would swoop in, retrieve the egg, and move
on. After about four incidents like that, Jessica had given up, wandering back
to Stacy, crying and just wanting to go home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At the time, they had
lived only about a block south of the park, so Clark had Stacy and Jessica return
home. He remembered giving his daughter a hug and watching her and her mother
walk toward the house. He then turned and walked to a small mall that serviced
the town in which they lived, a community of about 40,000. He found an open
specialty shop, bought the stuffed bear and a basket full of the best candy he
could buy. He then walked home, stashing both bear and basket behind a large
acorn tree in the back yard. The presents hidden, Clark stepped in through the
rear sliding glass door of his house, crept up behind Jessica, and wrapped his
arms around her with a big hug that only dads can give. She squealed with shock
and delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sometimes the
Easter Bunny visits houses, too, you know," he whispered to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Really?" She
asked. He remembered how her eyes had flown open wide at the news. "But what if
the other kids come and get it before I get there?" She looked down, as if she
were about to cry again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Won't happen,
sweetie. Why don't you and mommy take a walk around the backyard and see if
he's been here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Ok! Mom!" She
yelled. Stacy had run to her, grabbed her hand, and walked out the sliding
glass door. Clark turned to pour himself a cup of coffee, a broad smile
appearing on his face as the shrill squeal from the backyard announced Jessica
had found her treasure. They both returned to the house running, Stacy holding
the basket and Jessica the bear. Clark remembered his daughter had continued to
run through the rear glass door, arms spread wide in her pick-me-up approach,
her new bear bouncing and flailing in her tight little grasp. Clark bent over
and lifted Jessica high into the air, settling her off-center from his body so
her head rested right in the side of his neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I love you,
daddy!" She said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Stacy came in from
the other side and wrapped her hands around them both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I love you, too,
Jack." She then nudged in, close to his ear. "You're a hell of a father, you
know that?" She choked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Jack?" Carri
watched Clark, eyes cast to the floor, shoulders beginning to heave slightly.
He said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh God, Jack. I'm
so sorry."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri took his
hand and led him to the bed. Clark didn't resist. He let her take his shoes
off, then his shirt. He then lay down, facing away from her in a fetal
position. Carri returned to the door and locked it. She then turned the light
off, removed her shoes, and planted herself right behind him, wrapping her arms
around him. For the next couple of hours, she held him, feeling his body heave,
the ragged breathing of a tortured soul letting go a torrent of pain.</p>
