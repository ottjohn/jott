<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Detective Paul Tobias
parked his unmarked cruiser on the 1100 block of East Wilshire Avenue and
stepped onto the dry, hot pavement. He was in Orange County, just south of
Santa Ana, and more than 35 miles north of the Boulevard of the same name made
famous by the riots of the sixties and nineties. The air temperature went well
beyond uncomfortable and may have even surpassed oppressive. It was like a hot,
heavy hand that pushed the entire southwest with an unrelenting preternatural
force. Halfway across the spongy roasted blacktop he stopped, removed his
camera-equipped PDA, and took a quick snapshot of the property in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The house was
decent enough: a three bedroom ranch tucked into a place called Corner Stone
Village. It sat back from the street a good thirty feet, a large bay window
prominent above a mess of poorly maintained evergreens. A beige front door
stood atop three concrete steps, positioned just to the left of the big window.
The door was nested within a small nook, providing an illusion of protection
against inclement weather. There appeared to be two bedrooms to the left of the
door, each with a small window. The whole facade was done up in very old,
off-white, siding that was cracked here and there and quickly approaching a
neglected state of misery. The front yard sloped slightly to a barely
functional sidewalk. The grass was brown with tinges of yellow. A large Russian
elm burst from the middle of the yard. To the right of the property, a
single-wide concrete driveway ramped up to an attached garage. The house was
pretty typical of those that got their start in the 1950's, during the post-war
boom. It would have been an almost peaceful sight if not for the police
cruisers, crime-scene tape, and a bustling crew of responders and specialists
who were now there working a murder scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So, what have we got
here, Sanchez?" Tobias asked the sergeant who'd been one of the first
responders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Stiff. Male subject.
Probably been dead a couple of days."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where's the body?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"In the living room on
a couch. Broken neck. Probably killed instantly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Shall we have a look?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez didn't answer,
just turned and led the way to the front door. Tobias was impressed by how the
sergeant had secured the area: every square inch of the front of the house was
marked with police tape with one exception: a service path from the middle the
curb to the front door. He had posted an officer at the bottom of the driveway
to direct foot traffic and to discourage nosy neighbors from interfering with
police work. As Tobias entered the house, he saw two specialists. One was
working the area immediately around the victim, the other getting ready to
process another area toward the rear of the house. There was a pathway from the
door to the kitchen and all around the couch made of butcher paper. It was used
for two reasons: to protect potential evidence beneath the people working the
scene, and to protect the people working the scene from the potential evidence
beneath. It wasn't standard protocol, just an extra layer to manage debris that
might make its way around the crime scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Looks uncomfortable,"
said Tobias, motioning toward the body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. Hell of a break.
Freakish. Think he did that to himself turning around too fast? I always worry
about that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias smiled at
Sanchez, then figured he'd get in his first stab at seeing how much the kid was
picking up. "So how do you figure the body has been here two days?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez smiled, as if
he were waiting for the question. "Well, there's no rigor, so the body has to
have been here for at least a day. We really can't rely on body temperature
because of this freaking heat, I mean ambient is pretty close to normal body
temps right now anyway. The face, however, is mottled and discolored, the smell
is pretty bad, and the body has a greenish tinge to it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Okay, that pretty much
covers 48 hours. Why not longer?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No fluid excretions
and no bloating."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Very good! I'm going
to make homicide detective out of you yet!" Tobias gave Sanchez a slap on the
shoulder, then took in the interior of the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, I'm assuming
since I don't see a latency team here, the place has already been dusted and
glued?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, they left about
an hour ago. The photographer's been here as well."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He do the whole
house?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yep. He did the front
yard and the back too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where's the log?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Out front with officer
Jenkins. I'll get it." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias watched Sanchez
as he slipped out the front door, smiling to himself at the kid's aptitude,
dedication, and exuberance.   Lately, any time he arrived at a crime scene, he
did two things: he talked to Sanchez to get a snapshot of what was happening,
then he looked at the logs. Logs provided the details: who'd been processing
the scene and what had been processed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez returned,
Tobias glossed over the tabulated details, annotating in his PDA the current
state of the scene: the place had been dusted and photographed; control samples
of carpets and flooring had been taken, probable zones marking the intruder's
position in the house had been identified, and test samples had been taken from
them. A general inventory of disturbances to the premises had been itemized;
elimination samples had been taken from responders to remove them from the
eventual suspect list; and the condition of the victim's body had been
summarized. The last remaining business appeared to be the completion of
forensic analysis of the body and the vicinity immediately around it. Tobias
figured he had at least another hour before he could actually do a detailed
walk-through of the scene. Nothing to do until then, so he turned to Sanchez
and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Let's go get some
coffee."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They claimed the rear
booth of a dirty, nearly empty diner called Santa Ana Brew. The air wafted a
mixture of grease, syrup, and strong coffee. The red vinyl cushions on which
they sat were cracked in regular intervals all along the surface, exposing a crusty
yellow, spongy material. The table reflected a style of decades past: its
perimeter wrapped with ribbed aluminum; its surface colored white with blue
speckles, the uniformity of which was interrupted here and there with ancient,
ringed coffee stains. The floor was a dirty linoleum that might have been white
once; the walls were adorned with strategically-placed prints of movie stars, each
employed to cover a crack or a blemish on the wall behind it. The place was a
mess and probably in dire need of a visit from the health department. Tobias
and Sanchez felt right at home. They ordered two coffees from a middle-aged
waitress sporting blonde hair a little too big and a red skirt a little too
short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, what do we
know?" Asked Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Did a background
check on the vic. Turns out, he did time for child molestation several years
back. Four years, but got released early for good behavior.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Had a chance to
talk to his parole officer yet?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez took a sip of
his coffee, then returned the cup to the table, centering it within an ancient
caffeine ring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Affirmative. His
name's Larry … &quot; Sanchez flipped through his notebook, found the name.
"Banderman. He told me the deceased, Zach Hassenback, gave him no problems. In
fact, he petitioned to have his ankle bracelet removed a full six months sooner
than the conditions of his parole specified. That was approved."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So far as we
know, Hassenback had rehabilitated himself, was working toward becoming a
righteous, productive member of society, until some guy comes along and almost
tears his head off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"As far as we know,
that basically sums it up," said Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, so I'm assuming
from your report that our vic remained clean for his entire time on the
outside?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Appears to be the
case, yeah." Sanchez took another sip from his coffee just as the blonde
waitress dove in to top them off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The interruption gave
Tobias a chance to make some annotations in his PDA. He pressed its tiny
keyboard with his fingers, prodded it's screen with his stylus, poked it some
more, and placed it back on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, how about basic
observations?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"First, the body: the
guy's neck wasn't just snapped. His head was damn-near ripped off. I talked to
the pathologist about that. Seems Hollywood's got that all wrong: if a guy's
prepared, it's almost impossible to break his neck by twisting it to the side.
The muscles and tendons are too strong. Even if the victim's not prepared, the
most a move like that is going to gain is torn muscles and tendons. Hell of an
injury, but no broken neck and no kill."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took a sip of
his coffee, felt his stomach churn out a rumbling protest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So what do you
think happened?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hassenback was
caught unaware. So the guy must've come up from behind. Could have been a
guest, but it's not looking that way. Whoever killed him was more than likely
laying in wait in a rear room. He picked his opportunity, then snuck up from
behind and broke the man's neck. But that's where I get a little confused,
boss, based on what the pathologist told me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You mean with
regard to the force required to break a neck?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. He said it
was almost impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias considered the
point for a moment. &quot;My bet is they'll find a chin-sized bruise on the
vic's sternum. That would indicate the neck was broken with a violent,
forward-rotating motion. The side motion was probably an afterthought,
something the perp did to ensure the kill.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked up to
the ceiling, rolled his head forward, then leveled a questioning look at
Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you're saying
it's easier to break a guy's neck with a forward versus a side rotation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. It's all
about force. There's only so much of it at your disposal with a side-to-side
motion. You're really at the mercy of arm strength. With a forward roll, the
perp could have used his whole body weight to help with the break. I've seen it
before. If the guy was big enough, just his body weight alone could have done
the job.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Prints on the body?"
Tobias asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"First pass indicated
none, besides Hassenback's own."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned back,
made a few more annotations in his PDA. "Perfect. No prints on the body; no
prints anywhere, more than likely. So the guy either cleaned up, or he was
wearing gloves. Maybe both. Which means we're going to be lucky if we find
anything at the scene."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, seems to be how
it's panning out," Sanchez offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, what else?
Anything?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, one other thing
sticks out. Little bizarre, actually. The vic's computer. The hard drive's
missing. I guess we could assume the computer was down for repairs, but the vic
was a convicted pedo, and those types don't like to go without their electronic
fixes for very long."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, a functional
computer would definitely be a priority. That it? Nothing else?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Nothing but the usual:
entry point was through the back door. A pane in the window was taken out and
placed behind some bushes in the back yard. And the house was tossed. Almost
every square inch appears to have been searched."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias a sip of his
coffee, and ruminated. As the leggy waitress with the big hair left the check
on the table, he looked at Sanchez and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Here's what I want you
to do: get the file on this guy, his whole history. I want to know how many
times he's been incarcerated and why. I want to know if any of his convictions
have been tossed due to technicalities. We need a comprehensive victim list,
and then we need a list of all the family members. We're going to have to start
with them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Sanchez scribbled in
his notepad, Tobias lost himself in his coffee mug, in the contrast between the
bone-white color of the ceramic and the deep brown color of the coffee it
contained. Something was bothering him, but he couldn't piece it together.
Something trivial. He looked up, found Sanchez staring at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just one issue. We
have a murder victim, a scene that appears to have been set to make the whole
thing look like a robbery, an attempt at misdirection, but …" Tobias looked
down at his PDA again, thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"But what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"If the perp was
trying to make this look like a robbery, why take just the hard drive? Why not
take the whole computer?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good question."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You ready for the
walk-through?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, let's go."</p>
