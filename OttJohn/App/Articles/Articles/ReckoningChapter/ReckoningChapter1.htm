<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Everybody waits.
It's an inescapable human condition. On average, people spend about three years
of their lives queued up and placed on pause, loitering in the
neither-here-nor-there as they pass the time in anticipation of some event. It was
just such an occasion for Jack Clark: a late Thursday afternoon on a blistering
Southern California day, suspended between events, languishing in a state of
inaction. He figured he'd spent more time waiting over the past two years than
he had during his previous forty. Today, he was waiting in a bedroom of a house
he'd never been in before, a house owned by a man he'd watched for some time, a
man who might have valuable information for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And he hated to
wait. He'd rather keep busy. Waiting allowed his thoughts to wander, to slip
into his unhappy past and uproot memories better kept buried. At least most of
the time, anyway. It was those memories that fueled him, motivated him, and
transformed him. Mostly, they were kept on a shelf, in a remote part of his
mind, close enough to reach when he needed them, but distant enough to keep
them from bursting into his consciousness and destroying him psychologically.
But when he waited for long stretches, when his mind grew tired of the games he
played to deflect the impinging thoughts, he'd lose control and succumb to a
mental conflagration fueled by rage and despair. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The unhappy
memories, the rage, and the despair all changed him, changed his thinking on a
fundamental level. He'd struggled with that during the first year, after it had
happened. He'd wondered what had become of himself, how he'd changed so
quickly. He'd done things he'd never have even considered in his previous life,
committed acts so egregious, so antithetical to his past values, he'd wondered if
he hadn't gone stark, raving mad. But he knew he hadn't. He'd suffered a tragic
loss that had pushed him to the edge of sanity, but he'd recovered from that.
And after thoughtful contemplation, he'd come to accept his transformation as
unavoidable. But tonight he was going to test his value system again. Tonight
would be his first kill. Circumstance had brought about the requirement,
necessitating the action. And his new value system, his new moral base borne
out of unimaginable loss, told him that sometimes murder is righteous. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd been watching
his present mark for two weeks. It was his standard protocol: observe and
learn. The information he'd collected this time around was unremarkable. The
man's name was Zack Hassenback.  He was probably on the south side of 60,
white, just under six foot, and no more than 160 pounds soaking wet. He had
silver-colored, oily, shoulder-length hair, and he favored loose-fitting
clothes, typically sporting over-sized slacks, pastel polo shirts, and loafers.
He had a long, thin face and a protruding, narrow nose set between large,
nervous eyes. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And he had a
jealously-guarded introversion. As his surveillance brought him closer to the
man, Clark noticed he barely acknowledged those around him: at work, he stuck
to routines that kept him away from shoppers and fellow employees. If he had to
communicate with either, his conversations were one-sided and brief. When
submerged in the ubiquitous press of humanity, Hassenback would keep his head
down and simply do his best to float through the throng unnoticed. His social
repulsion appeared to extend to the core of his personal life too, as Clark had
observed not once a single visit from a friend or relative.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Small and mousey
was good, but what Clark appreciated most about Hassenback, what allowed him to
choose a house call over other methods of encounter, was the man's
predictability:  he arrived home every night at 6PM, driving the same route
from his place of employment without deviation. Upon arriving, he invariably
threw his shirt on the floor, walked to the kitchen to grab a beverage, sat on
his couch, and watched television. And there he'd stay. With the exception of
bathroom breaks and trips to the kitchen, he'd never seen the man use any other
room in the house. Every night just before midnight, he'd turn out the lights
and simply fall asleep where he lay. His routine was consistent to a fault,
perhaps even obsessive compulsive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Hassenback's
consistency made Clark's infiltration of his house simple. He'd started in the
early afternoon, decked out in urban camouflage: light-blue pants, a
short-sleeve white shirt,  a ball cap, and a four-by-six tablet and pen in hand
to complete the effect. With a satchel at his side, he looked like any of
hundreds of meter-readers who daily walked the sprawling Los Angeles
neighborhoods. None of the neighbors would give a second thought to Clark
walking into the man's backyard; none would notice that he hadn't re-emerged as
meter-readers should; and none would have any idea that the meter itself was
nowhere near the rear of the house but on its south-facing side, hidden behind
a riotous stand of overgrown shrubs. Of course, it didn't hurt that most of the
peering eyes that could give him trouble were not at home at the time. It was,
after all, a workday.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd entered the
backyard through a wooden gate hung on a low-cut fence, then surveyed his
surroundings. The lot was small and bisected by a little path that lead from
the back of the yard to the rear door of the house. Strategically-placed willow,
spruce, and Eucalyptus trees crowded the doorway, effectively obscuring it from
view. Even better, the door was old and wooden, it's top half consisting of
small, rectangular glass panes squeezed between a flimsy checkered frame. He
placed his satchel on the ground, opened it, and retrieved a pair of cotton
gloves and a standard screwdriver. He put on the gloves, then set about
removing the woodwork from around the glass plate nearest the door handle. He
was in the house in less than a minute, just before four in the afternoon. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Once inside,
Clark placed his satchel on the floor, sat next to it, and removed a small
plastic bottle of sodium hydroxide, a pair of rubber pool shoes, a
light-weight, hooded vinyl jogging suit, a surgical mask, and duct tape. He
removed his clothing, placing the articles directly in his satchel, then
dressed himself in the garments he'd brought with him. He used the duct tape to
seal openings between his body and the environment around him, then used the
sodium hydroxide to clean his outerwear, his bag, and the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By four-thirty,
he'd secured himself in the bedroom closest to the living area, then did his
best to get comfortable. Five minutes after that, he busied his mind with
mental gymnastics, most of which centered on visualizations of the takedown and
subsequent interrogation of Hassenback. It wasn't going to be complicated.
After a half hour of rehearsal, he grew bored and abandoned the exercise in
favor of determining the first hundred prime numbers. Anything to keep him
busy. Anything to keep the thoughts at bay. He hated to wait. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark got to two
hundred and twenty three before he heard a car roll up the driveway. Seconds
later, he heard the front door unlock, then the sound of the door opening and
softly colliding with the wall behind it. There was a slight rustle of fabric,
then the sound of footsteps crossing from the living room into the kitchen. He
heard the rattle of glass containers as Hassenback opened his fridge. There was
a pause in the cold cacophony and then the sound of released carbon as he
opened his beverage. A moment later, he heard the squishing sound of compressed
upholstery as Hassenback settled into his couch and switched on his television.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Trash can tell you
a lot about a person. It told Clark Hassenback's drink of choice was beer. Lots
of it. So he decided early on to use the man's addiction as leverage during his
interrogation. He researched the whole idea of using alcohol as a truth serum
and found it held some veracity. The key when using alcohol is to determine the
appropriate amount: too little, and there's not much effect; too much, and
truth quickly changes to incoherent, useless ramblings. When supplied with an
appropriate quantity, and consumed relatively quickly, he learned subjects tend
to relax, lose inhibitions, and respond frankly to most lines of questioning.
Given Hassenback's slight frame, Clark figured he'd be ready to talk after
about two or three drinks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So he continued to
wait. But it wasn't so difficult now. His mind was engaged, focused on the
permutations of possibilities, a modified direction brought about by the
acquisition of new information. Information he needed to get him to the end of
a long road, something that would allow him to keep a promise he'd made almost
two years before. Maybe a little inebriation would loosen up the information,
provide him with a treasure trove he could use to bring a quick end to a long
hunt. The only wildcard in his strategy, of course, was an untimely trip to the
restroom by Hassenback, followed by an uncharacteristic detour to the bedroom
in which he was waiting. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By 6:30 in the evening,
Hassenback had demolished two beers and was working on his third. Clark focused
on the layout of the house and once again pantomimed the steps he'd take to
make his way into the living room. He was currently on the east side of a
stubby hallway that lead from the living room and kitchen area to the rear of
the house. Turn left at the end of the hallway and he'd be in the kitchen; turn
right, and he'd be in the living room; turn right and take four large steps,
and he'd be at the front door. Slowly walk to the end of the hallway, crouch
and crawl in a north north-east direction about ten feet, and he'd be right
behind the couch, just behind Hassenback. The couch faced the north wall, which
was obscured from view by a large entertainment center, into which was tucked a
27 inch T.V. The wall to the east held an enormous window, which was obscured
by heavy, light-blue drapery. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark waited another
five minutes, figured that was enough time for Hassenback to drink half his
beer. Then he slowly crouched down on the floor and peered into the hallway. He
saw nothing, just the capricious light from the television casting dancing
shadows on the ceiling and adjacent walls. When he'd initially made his way
down the hallway and into the bedroom, he'd systematically tested the floor for
weaknesses, located spots at which the floorboards creaked when he made his way
in either direction. He'd found the flooring on the east side of the hallway
was the quietest, so he began crawling on his hands and knees out of the
doorway toward the living room, using that side of the floor. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When he was about
halfway to the living room, Hassenback got up. Clark stopped and remained still
for a moment. Bathroom breaks didn't typically happen for another thirty
minutes at least; beverage replenishment not for another few. As he watched the
man's shadow dance in the light of the television, he got into a prone position
and pushed himself tight against the wall behind him. He was in the shadows,
his body barely covered in darkness. If Hassenback were heading to the kitchen,
he'd probably be okay; if were heading toward the bathroom, he'd have to ad-hoc
the first part of their encounter. Hassenback chose the kitchen. No sound of
the refrigerator door opening and closing; no release of carbonation from a
freshly-opened beverage. No sound he would expect. The shadows moved once more,
and Hassenback was once again in the living room. Clark heard the electronic
whine of a DVD-player opening and closing, and then the light from the
television changed its hue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark was still on the
floor, facing the opposite wall. He found himself staring at a portrait of
Jesus. The irony was far from lost on him. He shifted his body so he was on his
hands and knees once again, then continued slowly toward the end of the
hallway. The sound coming from the television was muted, which made his
approach a little more difficult: no background sound to absorb a random creak
from the floor, nothing to swallow even the sound of his own careful movements.
The only palpable sound in the house came from Hassenback himself. Heavy,
labored breathing. It took about five careful minutes to reach the end of the
hallway. From his vantage point, Clark couldn't see the television, only the
rear of the couch and the back of Hassenback's head. He wasn't moving,
apparently transfixed by what was unfolding in front of him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark sat
motionless, timing Hassenback's breaths, then carefully stood in cadence with a
particularly laborious exhale. He was no more than three strides from the man,
directly behind him. He could see the television over the back of his head. Its
light burned into his brain, quickly forming neural pathways to embed an
unwanted memory. He could feel his pulse race, his face flush, and his
extremities tingle. The images flashing in front of him obliterated any
opportunity for interrogation. It didn't matter how important the information might
have been to him, how relevant it could have been in getting him on the right
path to knowledge. Nothing mattered but incredulous rage and a single, fiery
objective: kill the man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark took three
quick steps, then simultaneously placed his elbows on the man's shoulders while
cradling the back if his skull, palms out, fingers interlaced. Hassenback's
reaction was predictable but fatal: the surprise of Clark's presence startled
him, and as a natural reaction he tried to jump up. As he did, Clark used all
of his 230 pounds to push the man's head into his chest while driving his
elbows into the front of his shoulders for leverage. The forces combined
provided sufficient pressure to snap the man's neck and shatter his left
clavicle. Clark followed with a quick counterclockwise rotation of the neck,
which left Hassenback's head pointing to the rear of the room and a little
toward the ceiling. Clark checked the man's pulse to be sure, stepped back to
catch his breath, and got to work.</p>
