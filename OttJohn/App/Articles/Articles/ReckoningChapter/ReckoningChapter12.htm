<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez arrived to
pick up Tobias just before one in the afternoon. He exited the unmarked and
walked a meandering concrete path that lead from the sidewalk to the front of
Tobias's large tri-level home. As he approached the house, he noticed Carol was
again busying herself with the flower garden that tightly bordered both sides
of the walkway. Having been semi-retired for the last couple of years, Carol
had used almost all of her spare time reading home improvement magazines in an
effort to maintain the house and beautify the yard. When she first started her
home improvement journey, her work was at most mediocre. As Sanchez approached
the porch that lead to the front door, however, he saw a transformation that
looked both artistic and professional. He sprang up the five concrete steps to
a small patio bordered by black wrought iron fencing and gave the house's heavy
wooden front door three hard raps. A moment later, Carol appeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good afternoon,"
he said, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes it is!" She
replied. "You're getting the grouchy guy out of the house so I can finally get
some work done!" She gestured with her head toward the interior of the house,
signifying Tobias was still inside, getting ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez smiled and
motioned toward the walkway. "I noticed you're in the middle of another grand
production out here. What are you doing with it now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh that. I
decided to rip out the miniature roses and put in Agave, Artemisia, and Baby's
Breath. Most of it's going to be Agave. They're fairly drought-resistant, which
is important these days with the Colorado drying up and water being so scarce
and all. I'm hoping the Artemisia and Baby's Breath will add some really nice
colors and texture around the thick, broad leaves of the Agave. Paul kept
complaining about bees infesting the rose bushes, too, and these plants seem to
attract less insects, at least the stinging kind."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm sure they'll
all go together really well. It's already looking very nice," he said, honestly
wishing he had the patience to do something like that with his small yard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol glanced
expectantly over her shoulder into the open doorway, looked at Sanchez, and
shrugged. She said, "Hang on a second, dear. I think Paul wants to get out of
here, so let me make sure he knows you're waiting." Carol left Sanchez on the
porch with the door open, a tacit invitation to either stay where he was or
enter. He stayed put. Less than a minute later, Tobias arrived at the door, two
travel mugs full of coffee occupying both hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Afternoon
Sanchez.&quot; Tobias said, mock frown plastered on his face. He motioned
toward the freshly-started yard work and said, &quot;Let's get going so I can
get back here and keep an eye on Carol."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol gave Tobias a
soft punch to the arm. Tobias looked at Sanchez, rubbed his shoulder, feigned
pain, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You see what she's
doing, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked toward
the yard, replied "Yeah, it's looking good, boss. Wish I could get her to do
this to my yard."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, well in my world
<i>good</i> is synonymous with <i>expensive</i>, pal. She probably didn't tell
you about the little porcelain wood nymphs she wants to plant around all those
alien-looking plants, did she?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave Tobias a
blank look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, they're about
fifty bucks a pop! And they're just going to sit out here in the elements and
get trampled on by neighborhood kids and dogs. They're a monumental waste of
money, too, in my opinion. I mean, I may as well just take a bunch of fifties
from my wallet and plant those in the ground. Same effect, right?" Tobias
smiled at his wife, kissed her on the forehead and said, &quot;Just kidding
sweetie; but, like you said, a man's gotta complain about something, or he's
just not being a man!&quot; He then walked down the steps, past her work, and
to the unmarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez didn't move,
gave Carol a quizzical look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Told you. He's being a
grouch. And he didn't get a lot of sleep last night, either. Something's
bothering him about one of the cases you two are working." She rolled her eyes
dramatically. "You know how he gets." She patted Sanchez on the back and then
said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Keep him safe, Juan.
He's getting close to retirement, and I'd like to keep him around for a while
so we can actually spend some time together."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Her message was delivered
with a lightness that betrayed its underlying seriousness. Sanchez knew Carol
would be lost without Tobias. Hell, either one of them would be a basket case
if something were to happen to the other. In all his life, he'd never seen two
people so perfectly matched. Their relationship was like something out of a
fifties television show. It was  different for him, though. He was so distant
from his family he was barely able to work out a one-week visit every couple of
years. The sum effect of that reality gave him a constant feeling of
disconnect, which built with time. Somehow, Tobias was able to sense this, just
knew when he needed to unwind on neutral ground, be in a place where he could
feel safe. Whenever he needed the sanctuary of home, Tobias and Carol were
always there for him, holding their door open, accepting him as a member of
their family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave Carol a
look of reassurance, said, &quot;I'll watch out for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol grabbed Sanchez's
hand, gave it a gentle squeeze. Sanchez gave Carol a peck on the cheek, then
turned and walked down the path toward Tobias, who was already waiting in the
car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez pulled away
from the Tobias residence and made his way to the 261, which took him out of
the upper middle class community of Lemon Heights, and sent him hurtling toward
the perennial metallic logjam that is Interstate Five.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first time he'd
visited Tobias's house, he was overwhelmed by its size and spaciousness. The
exterior presented an older, three-level ranch that just about screamed Brady
Bunch. Behind its ordinary facade, however, was almost 5000 square feet of
ceramic tile and hardwood floors, two fire places, a large gourmet kitchen,
three full bathrooms, and four bedrooms. The master bedroom sported a pair of
walk-in closets and a bath with a very large Jacuzzi tub and a separate shower.
The house had large windows all around that offered spectacular views of both
the valley and the full acre of land on which it was situated, which was
populated with various types of trees, gardens, and a large Koi pond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At the time, Tobias had
occupied the home for more than ten years and so had become accustomed to his
guests'  trouble with reconciling a cop's pay with the obvious immensity of the
mortgage payment that would accompany such ownership. The key, Tobias had told
him, was to not <i>buy</i> the property but to <i>inherit</i> it. As it turned
out, Carol had a very rich uncle who'd worked in the financial sector in New
York City. The house was a winter retreat for him. He had no children, so he
had essentially adopted Carol as his own child when she arrived in the L.A.
area to attend college. Upon his passing, Carol had inherited the property,
which was fully paid for. Place like that in the country, the relative quiet
compared to the big city, and nothing to pay for but property tax. Some guys
have all the luck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias had remained
quiet since they left the house, simply leaned back in the passenger seat and
appeared to be ruminating about what the day might hold. The inconsistency in
the flow of traffic on the five, though, brought him out of his meditation; so
he retrieved his PDA, punched it a couple of times, and began focusing on that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Whatcha looking at?"
Sanchez asked, attempting to break the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"One of the documents
we got from the thumb drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You got that on your
Palm?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's actually a
Samsung, but, yes, I scanned it this morning and transferred the image."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I thought there were
ten documents."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There are. None of the
others are terribly interesting. Just the sort of crap you'd expect pedophiles
to send each other. This one, though, is different. Strange, actually."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez crawled in the
traffic, finally passing over Newport Avenue. He briefly glanced over at
Tobias, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So what's so special
about the document you scanned?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias pondered the
question for a moment, then replied, "Well, on its surface, it has nothing to
do with pornography. It appears to be a marketing blast from a local bank about
an investment opportunity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So what's so strange
about that? I get crap like that in my inbox all of the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There's something not
right about it. The thumb drive was all about porn, except for this one
document; and, you have to admit, it's certainly not representative of what we
would expect a couple of pedophiles to exchange."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez though about
that, then offered, "Are you sure they're <i>both</i> pedos?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, there was
another document that was signed the same way as this one. It was a copy of an
email suggesting Hassenback visit a particular pornographic site. It had lots
of images of little girls with their clothes off. I'm sure the forensics team
at LAPD Headquarters is already working with the Internet Service Providers to
track those responsible for the content, but I'm going to give them a call later
today just to make sure. If we're lucky, they'll all be in the states and we
can get the sites removed without much of a problem. They're probably in China,
though, in which case there won't be much we can do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez took the
interchange and merged onto the 55, heading southwest. Tobias sat next to him,
furiously typing something into his PDA. A moment passed, then he smiled and
let out a barely audible chuckle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?" Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It appears the bank in
the document, the San Andreas Bank, doesn't even exist. In fact " He punched
his PDA a few more times, waited a moment, and continued, "neither does its
address."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're getting
all that from your Palm?&quot; Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;PDA. Personal.
Digital. Assistant,&quot; replied Tobias, giving Sanchez a mock look of
impatience. &quot;And, yes, I'm getting all of this as we drive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Damn, boss. I
gotta get me one of those!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So we're looking at
either a marketing mock up or some kind of cipher through which these guys
communicate," said Sanchez. "A code seems pretty elaborate for bunch of
pedophiles to be using, though, don't you think?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'm really not sure,"
replied Tobias. "But at this point, I'm going operate under that assumption."
He scanned the document and then continued, "Too many key words here are
raising red flags. Given the context, I'm pretty sure we have something here.
We just need to figure out what it is."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Roger that," replied
Sanchez. He took a left on East Chestnut Avenue, a right on Warren, looked for
the third house on the left, then parked in front of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark sat at the
table in his rundown weekly, rapidly bouncing his knee in a futile attempt to
spend the nervous energy that pulsed through him like an electric current. At
3:15 in the afternoon, he'd sent an email to a guy named Eduardo. From the
account of a dead man. A guy he killed, Mr. Hassenback, former child molester.
The moment he sent the email, however, he'd wished he hadn't. Not because he
felt he'd made a mistake emulating Hassenback's style, but because he hadn't
really thought about whether Eduardo kept up with the news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>To be sure, the
murder of Zach Hassenback had not been front page material. In fact, it had
barely merited a mention in the crime blotter in the least-read section of the
paper. In a city full of celebrity gossip and upper-crust crime, the story of a
convicted sex offender struck down in a non-descript part of town held very
little appeal to the masses. But there was still the possibility, and to send
an email from a dead man would do Clark no good if its recipient knew the sender
to be deceased. In fact, if Eduardo knew Hassenback had been murdered, such an
email just might be enough to send him to the authorities for protection. That
could take Eduardo out of his reach, and Eduardo was the only link Clark had to
the organization that destroyed his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark silently
watched his computer and waited for a reply, admonishing himself for his
mistake and mentally stacking up adjectives to describe his uncharacteristic
flaw in planning. His mental self-flogging, however, came to a quick end at
3:30 in the afternoon when his mailbox chimed to signify a newly arrived
message. The very fact the email was now in his inbox told him two things: one,
Eduardo had no idea Hassenback was dead; and, two, he now had a very welcome
green light to continue with his operation, albeit much more carefully. The
electric nervous feeling now replaced with productive energy, he took a sip of
afternoon brew, a vanilla roast Carri had left behind, and opened Eduardo's
reply:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>H.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Good to hear from you! Yeah, let's
talk. Whenever you want man. No worries. I can do it today. Not much going on.
Just sitting around getting high and watching Gilligan's Island. Gilligan is a
trip, man. Shit. Hey, you should come over. Let me know, dude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark thought about the
email. Based on his observations of Hassenback and his apparent revulsion for
companionship, he'd figured there might be a chance Hassenback and Eduardo were
nothing more than acquaintances bound together by a common interest and the
internet. The email, however, left some doubt: <i>your place or mine?</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He suspected he
wouldn't be so lucky as to have Eduardo email him directions to his place. That
would be way too easy. Even if the email had given no intimation the two had
previously visited, asking Eduardo for that would be too risky, stupid even. He
would have to think of something else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Perhaps he could get
Eduardo to meet him at the Hassenback residence ... Clark grunted to himself,
quickly dismissed the idea as a byproduct of a synaptic misfire and wishful
thinking. The place was still more than likely red hot, and it probably still
had remnants of police tape scattered about the yard. Even if the residents and
the police were no longer actively monitoring the property, the tape alone
would be more than enough to keep Eduardo from going anywhere near it. Going
there was just out of the question. He took another sip vanilla brew, which was
all but destroyed by the little coffee maker, and tried word association to
spark some ideas: <i>hot, red hot, uncomfortable, inadvisable, suffocating,
flee the fire, room to breathe</i>. The house was too hot. Perhaps he could
make Hassenback too hot as well. He placed his coffee cup on the table, slipped
into Hassenback's sloppy style, and wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Lets meet at 7. Cant meet at your
place. POs been clingy. Fuckers been checking up to much. Meet at Gypsy Den in
santa ana. You no were that is? Let me no.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>H</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>PS: forget
Gilligan man. You shuld be loking at mery ann. To old but still hot ;)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark scrutinized
his email, gave the Gilligan's Island reference a few minutes' thought.
Hassenback and Eduardo seemed to have an obsession with the old television
show, having mentioned it in 16 of their 40 emails. No other shows, just
Gilligan's Island. He figured it couldn't hurt to leave it in, understood, too,
that leaving it out might be a mistake. He scanned the rest of the message for
style flaws. He found it painful to write so sloppily, felt a little anxious
about getting into a protracted electronic conversation. Several additional
exchanges might cause him to become careless, cause him to send a message so
inconsistent with Hassenback's style as to attract Eduardo's attention. After
several re-reads, he could find no glaring flaws, so he let it go. Eduardo's
reply came just five minutes later:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>H.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>I know where it is. Good idea.
Fucking parole officers! We can have a cup of brew and talk about the
opportunity. Then we can go to my place if you want to get with the program.
Hope you do! The place rocks dude.  Yeah, too old man, but Ginger is better.
You know it. But Gilligan is the man. You should see what he is doing with this
monkey man. Ha. Trip. See you at seven. Hey, we should do another marathon!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark quickly
scanned the email, felt a brief surge of satisfaction that his electronic
diversion had worked. He looked to the lower right-hand corner of his laptop
screen. It was 3:45 in the afternoon. He had a lot of preparation ahead of him,
lots of things he'd have to work out before he could meet Eduardo. Of course,
he wasn't going to meet the guy in public. Rather, he'd set up about a block
away from the coffee shop and wait for him. He'd purposefully chosen the Gypsy
Den because he'd been there before, knew it was a little out of the way and
lacked large crowds. He had no idea what Eduardo looked like, but given the
relatively few number of arrivals to these types of establishments in the early
evening, picking him out wouldn't be too difficult. He'd just sit and watch for
him, identify him, wait for him to get discouraged and leave, and then follow
him home. Poor Eduardo. His little buddy was dead. And as soon as Clark got
what he needed from him, he would be too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The two men in the
older model Jaguar were accustomed to driving ten mile circuits that would take
them through mostly lower middle class residential areas clustered in and
around the valley. Generally, they would watch four or five houses on any given
route, the distance between each being approximately the same. The routes
always included passes around public parks and libraries, and they were always
nested within a web of streets, parkways, and highways. At the first indication
of heat, the men could take any number of roads and simply disappear into the
urban jungle. A full circuit of a route typically required about 45 minutes to
drive, although the boss insisted they take at least an hour, but not more than
an hour and a half. The standard operating procedure required the use of a
different vehicle every two circuits. Upon completion of those, the drivers
were to return to base to collect a new car and continue their assignment. The
organization had seven cars in its fleet, ranging from the Jag they were now
droving to a late model Cadillac Escalade. The operation itself was called
trolling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The driver, Rick, knew
the present operation didn't fall into typical operational parameters. Instead
of being tasked to watch four or five houses along a circuit, he and his
partner, Jason -- his trainee, really -- were now watching just one. Further,
the single house they were presently working was situated in a lavish
neighborhood bordering Beverly Hills, a long way and a about two million
dollars from some of the lower-end neighborhoods they were accustomed to
cruising. While the route was unusual, Rick had run it before, each time tasked
to watch the same house. He figured they were testing the waters. The product
potential offered by such a route was enormous, but the risk was very high,
which necessarily truncated the scope of their directive. He also figured it
was a waste of time. Take someone's kid from the hood, and you'd need a shoe
horn to get a cop out of his car to investigate, but take one from the neighborhood
he was currently trolling? Forget about. You'd have so many cops up your ass,
you'd need surgery just to get them out. But he didn't plan the routes, nor
would he ever. They were planned a little further up in the organization, by
people holding positions he figured he'd never fill. He really wouldn't want
to, anyway. He didn't like the mission. But the pay was just too good to pass
up. Once a route was planned, it was submitted to the boss, who either approved
or killed it. When a route was delivered, it was to be driven. No questions
asked. Bottom line, it was the boss's orders, and you simply did what he asked.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick had been
driving the entire morning, listening to a proliferation of senseless babble
spilling out of Jason for most of that time. After about two hours of
mind-numbing stupidity, he'd turned up the radio almost full blast, attempting
to drown out the white noise that seemed to just erupt from the man. The
strategy had given him some relief but provided its own set of headaches. In the
meantime, they got as comfortable as they could while driving the route, smoked
cigarettes to pass the time, and caught periodic glimpses of a spirited little
girl making random appearances in the front yard of the residence they were
tasked to watch. At times, she seemed to be running with imaginary friends,
calling out to them and beckoning them with gestures and squeals. At her heels
every step of the way was a short, yappy dog nipping at her shoes as she ran. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Just as they were
about to once again drive past the house and begin another circuit, Rick's
phone rang. He sucked in his breath, shifted gears to mentally prepare for an
intentionally vague conversation. It was the organization's way to reduce risk
while on the phone: never mention specifics, abstract the conversation to a
level only the parties on the line could really understand. He exhaled, flipped
open his phone, and held it to his ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Rick. Talk," he said.
There was a brief pause on the other end of the line, then</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You two keeping an
eye out?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes sir. Yeah,
everything looks fine. Everything's quiet and the product looks good, just like
you said."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You keeping to
the prescribed pattern and interval?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"As ordered," he
lied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Make sure. No
fuck ups.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes sir.
Understood," Rick deadpanned. He wasn't sure about Jason, but he'd been doing
this sort of thing off and on for years in one form or another. Only with
adults. The target may change; the geography may change; but the fundamentals
of surveillance always remained the same. So what gave the fuck on the other
end of the line the right to tell him how to time his routes? Rick moved the
phone slightly away from his ear, allowing the moment to pass; he worked on his
breathing, attempting to find his inner Chi. After several seconds, a
peacefulness descended on him, pushing the negative energy away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You still
there?</i> The voice bristled, impatient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes
sir,&quot; answered Rick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Okay. Keep to
your pattern. Anything happens, you let me know. Immediately. That's the future
of our product. Anyone makes a move on it, run interference. Is that clear?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Understood. What
time you want us out of here?" Rick asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You two are
staying all night, into tomorrow. Get some coffee and stay awake. And don't
forget to swap!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick once again
took a deep breath, focusing on the harmonious connection between his mind and
body. Perhaps his boss needed to do that too. He seemed so tense. Maybe someday
he would suggest it to him. Or maybe he'd just put a foot up his scrawny ass instead.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Roger that,&quot;
he acknowledged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>One more thing
...</i> The Voice changed its tone, lost its edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes sir."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>How's the new
guy Jason working out?</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay.
Problems here and there, but they may be manageable.&quot; Rick kept his voice
at an even keel, spoke in a business-like manner to keep the guy sitting next
to him from figuring out he was the topic of this new thread in the
conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>He's got one
more week of apprenticeship, then I'm going to need a report from you.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm building
it as I go, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>How would you
rate him on a scale of one to ten right now?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;About a
six,&quot; he lied. He wasn't exactly sure how he'd rate the guy. He knew he
didn't want to work with him because he was a bona-fide moron. But this kind of
job didn't exactly require the mind of an Einstein, either. Truthfully, he just
didn't know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Well, if he
can't work up to a solid eight, you know what to do.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before Rick could
get another word in, the line went dead.</p>
