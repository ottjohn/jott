<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias lay in bed
staring at the alarm clock, the display burning the time into his eyes,
branding them with its garish yellow color. The rest of the room was almost
pitch dark, and if he looked away, he could see the clock's afterimage each
time he blinked. He closed his eyes, tried to will himself to sleep. The time
2:31 hung in the darkness behind his closed lids, darting left and right as he
moved his eyes, finally floating away and dissipating after several minutes. He
let out a deep, heavy sigh, then spent the next few minutes attempting to
identify the first forty prime numbers. It was an exercise he'd used many times
in the past when he couldn't get to sleep. Typically, under normal
circumstances, he'd be out by the time he got to 111. The math involved in
ensuring the number was prime took longer as the numbers got larger, so by the
time he'd reached the hundreds his mind would be exhausted. Not this time. He
gave up at 137. He wasn't going to get any sleep because something was nagging
him. A persistent thought kept breaking into his stream of consciousness like
an air raid siren splinters a peaceful silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And it wasn't really a
thought. It was more like a gut feeling, a powerful intuitive sense he had
about the Hassenback case. He'd had gut feelings before. Lots of times. When he
had them during the day, he could easily do something about them. He could wrap
them into his workday and act on them. When he had them at night, however, he
invariably lost sleep. Tonight's gut feeling told him if he put off the work
required to find Eduardo even a minute longer, he'd be too late. Eduardo would
be dead, and his suspect would be gone. Sometimes he acted on the feelings;
sometimes he didn't. When he did, he found them to be correct about fifty
percent of the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's wrong,
sweetie?&quot; Carol rolled toward her husband, placing her left elbow beneath
her for support. &quot;You haven't slept a wink all night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I've slept
some.&quot; Tobias protested, looking again at the clock, facing away from
Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Right. You've
been laying over there sighing like a little kid who wants a toy but can't have
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry.&quot;
Tobias rolled over, stroked Carol's hair with his left hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's okay. Unlike
you, I don't have to work tomorrow if I don't want to. I can just stay in bed
and sleep until noon after you've gone.&quot; She smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias flopped over on
his back, stared up at the ceiling into the darkness. His eyes adjusted,
leveraged the meager light coming from the alarm clock, which allowed him to
just make out the ceiling fan above him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I know. But
I ruined our evening working, and now it's ruined my sleep and yours. I guess I
still need to learn when to put my problems away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You thinking
about what you were working on earlier?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot; The
word came out throaty, like it had been dug out from the very pit of his
stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know how you
get, Toby Bear.&quot; She teased, labeling him with the moniker she created for
him in college. &quot;You know you're not going to be able to sleep all night.
Just go do what you have to do. I don't mind. You'll just owe me one.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She rubbed his chest.
He propped up onto his elbows, leaned over and gave his wife a tender kiss on
the lips. He knew he was the fortunate one in their relationship. He figured
she knew it too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll take you out
for a steak dinner later this week, okay?&quot; He said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That would be
great, honey, but you know I don't eat steak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh yeah. I keep
getting your tastes mixed up with my girlfriend's. How about fish?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's
better. Now go do your work and let me sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave his
wife another kiss, then got out of bed and headed for the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias walked into
his kitchen at 3:10 in the morning. He made some coffee, then rummaged through
the refrigerator looking for leftovers that might quiet his rumbling stomach.
Finding nothing, he contented himself with a couple of peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. He resumed his place at the kitchen table he'd occupied only hours
before, picked up his cell phone, and made the first of three calls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first was to
the night team in the Computer Forensics Lab at LAPD. He didn't call the LAPD
lab because he had doubts about his department's ability to work computer
forensics. He called because he knew that, save for a couple of patrols units
and a night clerk, his department was empty. After three rings and a request to
speak to the duty officer, a Lieutenant Dursk picked up the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Dursk. Help
you?&quot; The voice was gravelly, sounded like it belonged to a guy in his
mid-fifties, a chain smoker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good
morning, Lieutenant Dursk. I'm Detective Tobias with the Pasadena PD. Was
wondering if you could help me with something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Depends on
what it is,&quot; Dursk replied, flatly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm on a
fresh case right now. Has to do with a dead sex offender, name's Hassenback. He
was in possession of a URL for a website that pedals child pornography. There
may be a local connection with regard to the site, as in local sex trade.
There's a time issue here, and if we could get some particulars ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Local?&quot;
The gravelly voice sounded incredulous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah,
local.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Give me the
particulars. I'll make sure we get right on it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias rattled off
the IP addresses for the website and its associated ISP. He knew he didn't need
to, but he gave Dursk the URL for the ISP as well and let the him know the
contact address was located somewhere in the Czech Repulic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds like
you've been doing a little digging,&quot; said Dursk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, a
little. Figured if you guys could help me, I could do a little grunt work for
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Czech
Republic, huh?&quot; Dursk let it hang in the air, weighing on the line like a
massive turkey vulture, bending it almost to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I
know. Probably not a snowball's chance in hell of getting any information out
of them at all. I'm sure it's worth a couple of phone calls and maybe some well
placed threats, though.&quot; Tobias tried to sound hopeful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Anything's
possible.&quot; Replied Dursk, tacitly confirming the probabilities were very
near zero. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias sighed,
then said, &quot;At any rate, I really appreciate you looking into this with
such short notice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not a
problem, Detective. When it comes to this kind of shit, you can wake me up in
the middle of the day, and I'll work on it. There's no place, you know what I
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias liked the
sound coming from the man's voice, took it to mean he was going to give it an
honest effort, no matter how badly the odds were stacked against him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You got that
right. With any luck, I'll have more for you later in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, what's
that?&quot; Dursk's inflection implied he was hoping for something that might
not lead to a dead end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I may have a
local ISP for you. Need it to find an email address of a potential witness,
another sex offender. The dead guy exchanged emails with him. If I can get you
the ISP, you think you can get me the address?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Now that's
something we can more than likely do. I'd almost guarantee it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Great. How
long you going to be at the office?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Barring a
site visit, I should be here until around ten in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Excellent.
I'll try to get you the name of that ISP before then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias hung up the
phone. The second call he made was to the answering service for the Pasadena
Superior Court. He simply asked the woman on the other end of the line to make
an appointment for him with the first-available magistrate in the morning. She
put him on hold, got back on the line about three minutes later, and told him
he could see a magistrate by the name of Robert Micheals at 7:30. She then told
him Michaels' office was on the first floor, room 128, and that she had blocked
out a half hour of his time. Tobias thanked her, hung up the phone, hoping he'd
be able to make the meeting without wasting the guy's time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The third call was
to Sanchez. He felt bad about asking, but he needed the help. Turning a fairly
well-kept, organized house was one thing. Turning one that had already been
ransacked and then subject to a police investigation was altogether different.
He figured by himself he might be there all morning. If he had Sanchez's help,
he might actually be able to make his appointment with the magistrate. Tobias
dialed. After five rings, Sanchez answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah,
Sanchez.&quot; His voice came across slurred, the words delivered from a tongue
deadened by a deep sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, kid.
Tobias.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was a
rustling noise on the other end of the line, then the sharp exhale, which
created a sound not unlike that made by a person thrown into a pool of ice-cold
water. Tobias felt a little wave of guilt flush over him, knew what was coming
next, attempted to offer reassurance, but Sanchez beat him to the line, panic
in his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tobias? Is
everything okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah,
everything's fine. Relax.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What
happened? Is Carol all right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I
...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez clipped
Tobias's response again, the early hour tying him up in panic mode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Ok. Just
tell me there wasn't an accident, a heart attack, an illness, or a death. Just
tell me that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias could hear
Sanchez breath out deeply, get himself under control. He allowed himself a
slight, silent chuckle. He didn't find any gratification in waking anyone from
a sound sleep at 3:30 in the morning. Generally, when calls come in at that
time, they're nothing but bad news. He should've predicted the reaction,
phrased his greeting differently. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, right? While he
did feel guilty about the call, he was genuinely touched by the concern. He'd
never let on about it, at least not explicitly, but he thought of Sanchez as
the son he never had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No, nothing
like that, kid.&quot; Tobias let his chuckle get a little louder, carry across
the line, let Sanchez know everything was definitely OK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez blew out
an audible sigh of relief, said, &quot;Then what the hell is going on, boss?
It's 3:30 in the freaking morning! You looking to go play pool and troll for
the ladies or something? 'Cause if you are, we might be able to catch some
hotties just leaving the clubs now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds
tempting, but I need your help.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;With
what?&quot; Sanchez asked, a quizzical tone in his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;With the
Hassenback house. You know how it was turned by our perp?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, we
need to turn it again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias briefed
Sanchez about the details he'd hammered out the night before. Was it really
just last night? After five minute's conversation, they agreed to meet at the
Hassenback residence at 4:30 in the morning, allowing for a 30 minute commute
time and a coffee run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias cradled the
phone, ending his last call of the morning. He quickly returned to the bedroom
and kissed Carol on the forehead and said goodbye. She turned away, mumbled
something about cats tracking through pancake batter. He stood there for a
minute, watching her sleep. He had a good wife, better than he deserved. He
could say the same thing about Sanchez. Better partner than he deserved. Both
of them had done so much for him over the time he had known them, never asking
for anything in return. He thought briefly about inviting Sanchez to the dinner
he promised Carol. Perhaps that would make up for the careless early morning
call. Then he thought about what his wife was wearing when he'd arrived home the
night before, thought about her come-hither look. He quickly reconsidered,
squashed the idea. He'd take the kid out for a burger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first order of
business when conducting an interrogation is to make the subject uncomfortable.
Not so much as to inhibit him from answering questions, but just enough to make
him understand he's not in control, just enough to make him want to be
forthright and motivated to get the questioning over with as quickly as
possible. Clark sat on the edge of Eduardo's ugly orange couch, balancing his
computer on his lap, scrolling through a document template to get to the first
of his pre-interview questions. He peered over the screen and looked at
Eduardo, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of him, his long
thin face now haggard and worn, his eyes showing fear and a little panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He felt good about
his position, felt he'd established an appropriate level of dominance. While he
was certainly on Eduardo's home turf,  he felt the earlier take-down and
Eduardo's current position on the floor had done more than enough to make the
man uncomfortable, perhaps too much so. In spite of his perceived level of
control, though, he felt an unaccustomed need to hurry, to move quickly through
the interrogation and get out. He didn't know if the feeling came from a lack
of planning, or if it came from an intuitive sense that the police were closing
in on him. Whatever the origin, he knew it didn't matter. He'd follow protocol
and continue with this interview as he had all of his previous ones. His first
few questions wouldn't be asked to collect pertinent information, though;
rather, they'd be carefully crafted and posed to help him set the tone for the
rest of the interview. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This leads to the second
order of business when conducting an interrogation: maximizing the subject's
psychological comfort under the distress brought about by the first rule. The
best way to do that is to make the subject believe he shares some common point
of interest with the interrogator. It lubricates the subject's tongue, gets him
to talk. And once he starts rattling off information, even information of no
consequence, he'll find it difficult to stop under any circumstance. And that's
where Clark needed to be. He took another quick look around the room, trying to
find something worthy of conversation. He'd occupied some fairly nasty dumps
over the past couple of years, but Eduardo's place literally merited a mention
in the dictionary next to the word <i>squalid</i>. Almost every fixture in the
place was either second-hand or employed in a non-traditional way to serve some
traditional purpose: milk crates were fashioned to serve as coffee and end
tables, the light fixture next to the couch had no shade and was probably older
than both of them, an old blue sheet was fashioned into a barely passable
curtain for the living room window. The couch on which he was sitting was by
far the best example he'd ever seen of a hand-me-down that should've been left
for dead years ago. Then he glanced over at Eduardo's computer. It was sitting
precariously on a rickety old desk, gleaming like a diamond in the rough. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nice
computer,&quot; he said, playing the delivery as if he were disinterested in
the task at hand, instead wanting to talk about something else. &quot;Where'd
you get it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo looked
confused by the question, but he answered anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Best Buy.
They had a sale.&quot; He tried to force a smile, couldn't pull it off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I really
like the monitor. Thing's gigantic. What's the resolution?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo perked up
just a little. &quot;Yeah, that's the best monitor they had. Cost a lot too,
about a grand. But it was worth it. Has a resolution of 1600 by 900.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark let out a
low whistle. &quot;No shit? I need to get one of those. How's the video quality
on it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Bad ass.&quot;
He paused for a moment, as if searching for the right words. &quot;The computer
will play regular and blue ray. Blue ray kicks ass on that screen. I spend a
lot of time on that thing. Might as well have the best, right?&quot; He let out
a nervous chuckle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Definitely. 
So how fast is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo grinned
with a little pride, as if he were talking about a successful member of his
family. &quot;Two processors. 2.8 gigahertz each. One terabyte hard drive. Six
gigs of RAM. It's a sweet machine.&quot; He practically cooed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark returned his
attention to the computer, shaking his head in disbelief. Not at the power of
the machine, but at how quickly he'd gotten Eduardo to a mental comfort zone.
But then again, how surprising was it, really? Most pedophiles are going to spend
a lot of money on computer equipment. It's how they get to their stash; it's
how they store their stash; it's the center of their universe. He typed an
annotation into his laptop:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>Answering matter-of-fact
questions: pantomimes with hands very little. Sits almost   perfectly
still. Eyes focused and forward. Seems more relaxed. Worry lines on face all but
gone. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>With respect to
their initial, short conversation, Eduardo's body posturing had given Clark a
point-of-reference, or a baseline, for what he should expect when asking him
straight-forward questions, ones that required little or no thinking to answer.
Most of the questions he'd ask Eduardo would fall into that category. But that
was only half of the equation, only half of the information Clark required to
determine whether Eduardo was being forthright with his answers. To better
focus the blurred chasm between truth and fiction, Clark had to also ask
Eduardo questions that required him to think creatively, so he could better
understand the man's outward pantomimes when fabricating. Clark raised a fist
to his mouth, stifled an affected yawn,  then gave Eduardo a sleepy smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds like
you're pretty good with computers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm pretty
good, I guess.&quot; A slight hint of wariness returned to the man's eyes.
Clark sensed the tension creep, raised his right hand in front of him, palm
out, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh, don't
worry. We're not starting yet. I just have an unrelated question for you.&quot;
He paused. &quot;I'm thinking about going back to school next year. Trying to
get away from this shit and get into a more nine-to-five routine, you know what
I mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I
guess so.&quot; Eduardo looked a little less tense, apparently happy the
conversation wasn't turning serious yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What kind of
computer would you recommend? You know, for going back to school?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why don't
you just use that thing?&quot; Eduardo motioned to the laptop perched on
Clark's knees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark caught
himself, shut down the look of surprise before it ever reached his face. Why
would he need advice about purchasing a computer for school when he had a
perfectly good computer sitting on his lap? It took him a split second to give
a reason: &quot;This thing?&quot; He pointed to his laptop with his right index
finger. &quot;This is the department's equipment. Using it for anything other
than police business is strictly forbidden.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh,
okay.&quot; Eduardo furrowed his brows, rubbed his chin with his left hand,
then said, &quot;What's your preference, desktop or laptop?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know,
I've thought about that, and I've kind of gotten used to the convenience of a
laptop, so I'd like to stay with one of those.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Gonna use it
for anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nope. Just
school.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Let's see
...&quot; Eduardo tapped the side of his legs with his hands, looked up to the
ceiling, and closed his eyes. He stayed in that position for about a minute,
then looked at Clark and said, &quot;I think you'd like the Toshiba. You could
get something pretty nice for about 700 bucks. It won't be blazing fast, but I
bet you could get a 17 inch screen, a fairly large hard drive, and a decent amount
of RAM. Oh, and all of them come with DVD players these days, so if you want to
watch movies or educational videos, it's handled.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark leaned back
as if to take in what he'd just heard. &quot;Ok. Let me just make a note of
that.&quot; He moved as if he were going to type in a note, stopped, looked at
Eduardo, and said, &quot;Gonna have to remember to delete this as soon as I'm
out of here, though. The guys at the station who manage these things are like
the Gestapo.&quot; Clark gave Eduardo a knowing smile, then typed in his observation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>Creative thinking: pantomimes
with hands much more. Closes eyes when working  through a problem. Looks up.
Furrows his eyebrows.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark finished
typing the note, noticed Eduardo continued to look relaxed. He wasn't. He still
felt a need to hurry. He knew from experience, though, that forcing issues lead
to mistakes, and a mistake in this case could lead to disaster. He took a deep,
silent breath and let it out, then forced himself to banish the urgent thoughts
for a while longer, pushed them into the back of his mind. He'd deal with them
later. Right now, he needed to get on with the meat of the interrogation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. I
guess we need to get to work. That way I can get out of here, and you can get
back to what you were doing. Ready?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo looked
nervous again, but much more comfortable than when he'd first taken the
position on the floor in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Do I have a
choice?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then I guess
I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark briefly
returned his attention to his computer, considered the core questions he asked
during interrogations. They were thorough and tailored to his specific
requirements. During each interview, he asked most of them and several others
the document did not contain. The supplementary questions didn't betray a deficiency
in his level of preparedness, however. Those questions were simply unique to
each particular case and by their very nature could not be anticipated. Those
he appended to the document as he asked them. He thought of one very important
question he'd be adding to Eduardo's document today, perhaps the most important
question he'd ever asked in his life: <i>where is the facility that held my
daughter?</i> He was impatient for the answer, but he knew he had to ask his
normal litany. Just in case something went wrong. Just in case he needed to
find another target. He desperately hoped that wouldn't be the case. He looked
down at Eduardo, fired off his first question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Where have you
lived over the past seven years?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo shifted his
gaze from the floor, looked in a direction just to the right of Clark. "L.A.,
mostly. But I've stayed in San Antonio, Dallas, and Memphis too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark made an
annotation in his computer. Eduardo fidgeted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can I ask you a
question?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked up.
&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I guess I don't
understand. Why you need to know where I've been? How does that help?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Gives us a sampling of
offender locations. From that we can look at associated population densities,
crime rates against children, and relative populations of the offenders
themselves. That, together with arrest rates, periodicity of offenses, and
target age groups of the victims gives us a decent picture of which offenders
operate alone and which tend to gravitate toward organizations that peddle
children in the sex trade."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> Regarding the method
under which Clark operated, most of what he told Eduardo was true, just on a
very small scale. In fact, in spite of the enormous amount of work he put into
his profiling system, he had mostly stumbled onto an attribute formula
regarding sex offenders that allowed him to distinguish their two
classifications with a great deal of success. He'd tried reading various
academic articles concerning the psycho-social profiles of pedophiles. At
first, they'd helped, had given him a starting point, but after a time they'd
lost their value. And appeal. He didn't like to read them. He found most of
them bloated, arrogant, and pedantic to a point that studying them almost gave
him dry heaves. Most of his real successes had come from simply plunging into
the lives of his targets and interrogating them in a way the social-psychology
community simply couldn't. The rest was borne out of a natural skill for
finding patterns in data and dumb luck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo appeared to
consider what Clark had said, then simply nodded his head. "Oh."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Next question: how
do you typically make contact with your victims?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Why do you need
to know that?&quot; Eduardo learned back, crossed his arms over his chest in a
classic defensive posture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I just told
you. We're looking for patterns in behavior, trying to differentiate profiles
between lone hunters and those who work in packs, remember?" Clark was
surprised by his impatience, immediately regretted his condescending tone.
Eduardo didn't appear too perturbed, simply nodded his head and answered the
question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Last time I got
busted, it was for inappropriate um ... activities with a girl. She was eight.
A neighbor's daughter. I befriended the family and worked my way in. That's the
way I work. It's sick, I know. But I can't help it. I've done it several times,
got busted twice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark annotated
the response. Lone hunter. Not exactly what he'd expected. He hadn't looked up
any information regarding the man's criminal past, but he'd suspected he would
have been busted for some kind of association with trafficking, given his
probable association with the facility. He again wondered if Eduardo hadn't
lied about his use of it. Perhaps he was just waiting for someone to go in
with. Perhaps Hassenback was that person. Maybe not. Perhaps he was
over-reacting: profiles were never perfect, and so far it appeared Eduardo
clearly marched to the beat of a different drum. Further, the context of his
emails had told Clark Eduardo had to have established some kind of relationship
with the operation: <i>The place rocks dude</i>. If he hadn't actually been
there, why would he indicate otherwise? Clark decided not to burn any more
energy on doubts. It was unproductive. Instead, he pushed on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Next
question: What do you consider your best online resources?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I only got
three.&quot; He looked down at the carpet, blanched. &quot;You sure I'm not
gonna get busted for this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nothing you
say to me will put you back in jail.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. Like I
said, I got three I use. One's <i>littlelolita.com</i>, another's <i>youngstuff.com</i>,
and the last one has no name. It's just an IP address. I can never remember
what it is, so I got it written down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark felt a
sudden rush of satisfaction and hope, followed closely by another wave of
urgency to end the interrogation quickly. He knew he had more information he
needed to gather, much more. But he made a quick decision to focus on
information about the site that didn't have a domain name, see where it would
lead him. He figured he'd include some questions about the other two sites as
well, in the unlikely event they were all related somehow. Clark allowed
himself a brief, inward smile. Maybe he could get the information he needed and
get the hell out of Eduardo's apartment sooner rather than later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where do you
keep the IP address?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;At my desk.
You want me to get it for you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. Just
stay where you are. Tell me where it is. I'll get it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But my
computer ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nothing you
say and nothing I see is going to lead to your arrest. We need information.
Consider it a trade for looking the other way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Go to the
computer. It's taped under the keyboard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark got up from
the couch, placing his laptop on the cushion next to him so the screen faced
away from Eduardo. He then walked around its ugly orange edifice, dodging dirty
laundry scattered between its backside and the seating area in front of the
half wall. He moved to the edge of the desk that supported the computer. He
looked at the keyboard. He lifted it. He closed his eyes. He wasn't a religious
man, but he found himself asking God to let it be the right IP address, let it
be the one piece of evidence that connects Eduardo to the organization that
murdered his little girl. He opened his eyes, held the keyboard with a nervous,
sweaty grip, then turned it over. A wave of excitement and satisfaction flushed
over him. Finally. It was the same IP address he'd gleaned from the phony
marketing literature. He held the keyboard in front of him, burned a minute to
regain his composure. He then put the keyboard down, returned to his position
on the couch, retrieved his laptop, and re-engaged Eduardo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You sure these
are the only sites you depend on?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Ok. Next
question. Other than the images, what is it about these sites you find of value?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark anticipated
Eduardo would have to think a little about his response and was ready to
disregard any outward expression that might indicate creative thinking. To his
surprise, however, Eduardo answered immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Storage
capability for my stuff, file sharing, and membership services." He said it
like he was reciting the contents of a shopping list. Clark made the requisite
annotation in his computer, then followed up with a clarifying interrogative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Can you tell me
more about the membership services? What do they offer?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"They have secure,
encrypted email and chat and storage. There ain't nothing that's not encrypted.
Hell, they practically guarantee you won't get busted ... if you store everything
with them. And for sixty bucks a month? It's a pretty good deal."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Have you used any
of the communication services?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Can you elaborate?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Huh?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Can you tell me
how these services are used?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"To trade and
share stories. A big draw for some of the members is to submit and rate them.
Um ... &quot; Eduardo thought for a moment, then said, &quot;the chat services
are used but not a lot. Most of the members are just looking for pics or
stories."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Any message
boards?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. But they're
never used, really." He thought for a second, as if he was considering
something important, and then offered, "Most of what's there requires a code to
open them and another to read them. And that costs money." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Two levels of
security. And probably an encryption system as well. Pretty safe way to manage
communications in an industry that strayed way outside the boundaries of the
law. He wondered how the big guns in computer forensics handled that. If what
Eduardo was telling him was accurate, he wouldn't have any chance at getting to
the items on the boards. Not with the tools at his disposal, anyway. But he'd
soon have Eduardo's hard drive, and that might give him an edge, just in case
he needed one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Next question:
have you ever received or sent any of these encrypted messages?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Which web
site?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The one with
the IP address.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Do all of the
sites you visit offer this service?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No. Just the
one."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark felt close,
now more confident than ever Eduardo had been to the facility. He wanted to ask
him about its location, but he needed another name first. Just in case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm curious.
How'd you become a member of a site with no domain name? It's not like you're
going to accidently type in its IP address, right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You have to
be invited by a current member. Then you have to actually go the dude's house
to ...&quot; Eduardo stopped suddenly, seemed to know where this was going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Who invited
you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I
forget.&quot; Eduardo glanced to his left, his fidgeting picking up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think you
do remember. I need the name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo tapped his
right knee twice, closed his eyes, then said, &quot;Frank. Frank
Sorensen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Fabrication. Clark
wondered if it really mattered, quickly dismissed the idea. Never take anything
for granted. He then spoke very softly, very deliberately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know
you're lying, Eduardo. I need the name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo shuffled
on the floor, rocked forward a little. His eyes were wider now, his breathing a
little more audible. It was obvious to Clark the man was moving away from his
mental comfort zone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Give me the
name or all bets are off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's that
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It means
I'll drag your ass downtown and charge your for possession of child
pornography. I don't need to tell you that's a felony.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But I
thought you said ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;In exchange
for information. You're withholding it. You're not keeping up your end of the
bargain. Give me the name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo seemed
highly conflicted. He sat perfectly still, the only movement being little beads
of sweat that had formed on his brow, which were beginning to trickle down his
face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, okay.
His name's Randy Matthews.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;When's the
last time you communicated with him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Last
week.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Email?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes ...
&quot; Eduardo paused, a look of panic written on his face. &quot;please can
you do me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Depends on
what it is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Randy. He's
connected. He finds out that came from me, I'm as good as dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He'll never
know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Clark typed the
name into his computer, he found himself making a critical decision: in the
most practical sense, he had all of information he required to find his next
target. Only one question remained. The most important he'd ever ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Last
question, Eduardo.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay.&quot;
Eduardo relaxed a bit, seemed to be bolstered by the fact the interrogation was
almost over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where's the
house?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Randy's
house?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. The
house the organization runs. The house behind the IP address. The house that
keeps all the children.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo's eyes
popped wide, his mouth fell open, and his breathing suddenly went ragged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was 3:30 on
Sunday morning when Gerkowitcz finally walked into the main house on his
property. He'd spent the better part of the evening in the dining room of the
guest house crunching numbers, trying to determine if he could afford his Chief
of Security's recommended enhancements. He had to admit, the man had some
pretty far out ideas, real secret agent stuff. At first he'd scoffed at the
augmentations, complaining they were going to be way too expensive and
unnecessary. Why the hell would he need a perimeter of god damned solar-fed
Minoltas surrounding his property in the middle nowhere, anyway? To his credit,
though, the chief had kept his cool, explained the nature of the business and
the attention it could attract from adversarial elements required such
safeguards, discretion being the better part of valor and all that horseshit.
He was convincing, enough so to make him reconsider, and then give the go
ahead with a plan for implementation. The numbers were good enough, anyway, at
least good enough to equip the place with sufficient measures to keep the
nefarious elements out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He walked through
the foyer and looked around. It had been more than a few years since he had
the old place rehabilitated, and he still found himself impressed with the
changes that had taken place. When he purchased the property, he felt certain
he'd have no choice but to tear the house down, his gut reaction telling him it
was nothing more than a moldy, rotten, decaying structure that couldn't be salvaged.
He fretted more than a little over that perception, wondering if he could both
demolish and replace the house while keeping his precious find a secret from
the small army of workers required for such an undertaking. But the general
contractor he brought out to inspect the house told him that besides moderate
exterior work and some serious interior rehab, it was basically as sound as the
day it was built. So he hired the guy and told him to replace everything: the
walls, the ceilings, the floors, the windows, the bathrooms, and the kitchen.
When everything was said and done, he'd not been disappointed. What had once
been nothing more than a highly functional abandoned building, now looked clean
and modern, furnished and decorated to bathe its inhabitants and visitors in a
rugged yet elegant Southwestern style.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he passed
through the kitchen, he paused briefly to pour himself a cup of coffee. He
didn't much like the taste of it, really, but like everyone else, he found it
highly effective at keeping his mental gears grinding. And he'd require a lot
more of it in the coming hours. He'd already been up for almost twenty hours,
and he figured it would be another twelve or so before he'd allow himself some
rest. He'd been mostly satisfied with the security enhancements, but there were
still some clarifications he needed, and there was still the matter of
inventory replenishment. He took a sip of his coffee, cursed under his breath
at scalding his tongue on the hot liquid, and then turned and made his way into
the basement, flipping a switch on the wall to light his way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Compared to the
rest of the house, the basement remained relatively unchanged. He'd decided
against major improvements there, unwilling to risk the chance of someone not
under his control gaining knowledge about what was buried beneath it. Besides
some trivial cleaning, the only major difference was the floor: instead of
dirt, it was now covered with pea gravel, which made it easier to conceal his
find. Its uniform compressive nature also dramatically reduced the odds of an
outsider inadvertently discovering the opening by noticing inconsistencies in
ground color and compression, as he originally had. He took another sip of his
coffee, studied the perfectly circular hole in the gravel. A hatch that could
have come from a submarine angled out of the ground above it, a built-in ladder
was visible through its opening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He lowered himself
down the steel ladder, which took him fully twenty feet below the floor of the
basement. The landing was dimly lit, about ten feet in diameter. He fumbled
around at the bottom of the ladder for a moment, located the bank of wall
switches, and flipped one that illuminated a long line of incandescent bulbs.
The lights were strung along the ceiling of a corridor that lead out of the
landing. The corridor led  to the main area of a bomb shelter, built by a crazy
old man almost thirty years before. He figured the guy had to have been crazy,
spending so much money on a facility that looked as though it had never been
used. He let out a soft chuckle as he took in the enormous cylindrical shaft:
old man's loss, his gain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He quickly walked
down the long corridor, which eased him approximately ten feet below the floor
of the landing. It opened into an large cavern, about 50 feet long, 75 feet
wide, and 20 feet high. When he'd first discovered the shelter, he found its
main area populated with four things: a greenhouse, which was centered in the
middle of ten holes bored into the concrete floor; an outdated, full-service
kitchen with a seating area that could comfortably accommodate ten people; an
entertainment area, which was furnished with old couches, lamps, end tables,
and an color television; and a fitness area, which sported a treadmill, two
stationary bikes, workout benches, and racks of free weights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Equally spaced
along the walls to his left and right were doors. There were ten altogether.
Behind eight them he'd found small but comfortable bedrooms. Each had a twin
bed, a dresser, a desk and chair, and closet space. The remaining two doors
opened to large full baths, each with four sinks, a large tub, and a shower
area with multiple shower heads. The far wall had only one door. Behind it was
another cavern, about half the size of the main one. It contained supplies. Lots
of them: hundreds of cans of chili, beans, fruit, vegetables, tuna, chicken,
and powdered milk. There was also about 4000 gallons of water. This surprised
him as the water to the showers and the kitchen worked. He figured the old man
had probably decided to plan for a worst-case scenario, something that might
either taint or knock out his water supply, some mega-disaster he never lived
to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he walked
through the shelter now, he literally breathed in its magnificent
transformation. What had started out a depressing concrete gray intertwined
with the damp reality of an underground structure now dripped with a welcome
freshness. If he were given a hundred years to think about it, he didn't think
he could come to terms with why the old man hadn't done something to make it
more livable. It had been functional, and that was about it. If the Armageddon
he'd been planning for hadn't have gotten them, certainly the oppressive
monotony of the shelter would have. After the contractor completed rehabbing
the main building, Gerkowitcz had immediately set out to remedy the deficiency.
He could not, after all, run his operation with such repugnant surroundings. So
he hired a bunch of day laborers and set about carpeting the floors and hanging
drywall to a height of ten feet all around the main living area: for the floor,
he'd chosen a light cherry Berber, for the walls a desert sandstone. Together,
the colors combined to give the whole place a homey, comfortable feeling and a
brightness that came close to making up for the lack of natural sunlight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He rounded out the
living area by enhancing or replacing almost everything: he painted the
greenhouse the same color as the walls, planted dwarf citrus trees in each of
the ten holes surrounding it, and wrapped the structure with a ten foot wide,
cream-colored tile patio. The lighting was mostly replaced with ground-mounted
light fixtures, giving the area around the greenhouse the look of an upscale
neighborhood. He completely gutted the old kitchen, replacing it with cabinetry
and appliances that were much more efficient and much more functional. He
purchased leather couches for the living room, surrounding them with sturdy yet
elegant coffee and end tables. In its far left corner, he set up an
entertainment center, the focal point of which was a 60 inch plasma television,
enhanced by theater-quality speakers, a DVD player, and a high-end stereo
system. In the far right corner, he set up two new ellipticals, a stationary
bike, and health-club rated nautilus equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As they were going
to be the centerpiece of his new operation, he'd paid particular attention to
the bedrooms. The twin beds were replaced with jumbo queens dressed up with
frilly comforters and matching throw pillows. On the interior walls, he mounted
40 inch plasma televisions, supplementing each with ceiling-mounted speakers
and a DVD player. For the outer walls, he purchased identical antique dressers
and matching roll-top desks. Each dresser came with decorative vanities, each
desk with a high-backed wooden chair. The remaining space on the walls was
broken tastefully by framed prints of landscapes from all over the world, the
walls themselves painted with appropriate colors and designs to complement the
prints. He'd been aiming for the worldly look of an old-time bed and breakfast,
something that would make his guests feel both at home and mentally stimulated.
Looking into one of the unoccupied bedrooms as he walked to the back of the
living area, he smiled to himself, figuring he'd succeeded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While he loved the
new living space, adored it even, it wasn't his favorite place to spend what
little free time he had during his visits. That distinction was solidly held by
one of the bathrooms, both of which had started as barely more than military
latrines, wrapped up in the same dingy dullness of the living space, only more
depressing. And much darker. In each, he'd tiled the floors, covered the
concrete walls to ten feet with peach-colored ceramic squares, and removed all
of the commodes, showers, and tubs. He'd kept the bathroom on the left wall
tied to customary duties, installing four toilets, four glass-enclosed showers,
and a pair of cream-colored, ceramic, three-basin sinks. The bathroom on the
right wall was his pride and joy: it had only one toilet and one glass-enclosed
shower. The rest of the space was filled with a steam room, a jacuzzi that
could hold up to eight people, and a full-service bar. He had a weakness for
hot water, alcohol, and company, and he estimated he spent a good ten percent
of his time in that one bathroom. Sometimes with company; sometimes alone,
thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He walked to the
rear of the living space and entered the storage area. Most of the staples that
had been kept in the middle of the room had been dumped into surrounding open
pit mines and replaced with food of better quality and taste. He decided to
keep the water, figured it might come in handy if he ever had to wait anything
out. Besides, it was all vacuum-sealed, so he figured there was no risk of it
being contaminated in any way. In the left rear corner of the room sat a brand
new walk-in freezer that held what was left of two of his cows, a variety of
fish, and hundreds of pounds of frozen chicken breasts. Prominently displayed
in the right rear corner of the room was a wine rack, holding 500 bottles of
various brands he especially liked. The only other embellishment to the space
was a small board room he'd built into its forward right hand corner, just
adjacent to his favorite bathroom. Its windowless walls were built twenty feet
high to push flush against the concrete ceiling and heavily insulated to render
them sound proof. He paused at the room's entrance, poked in a five-digit pass
code, walked in, and closed its heavy oaken door behind him.</p>
