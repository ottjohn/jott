<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned back
in his patio chair, soaking up sun and breathing in the scent of barbecued
steak wafting over the yard. As he took a sip of wine, he thought about the
walk-through he and Sanchez had conducted at the Hassenback residence.
Something was nagging at him. It was there, right at the periphery of
recognition, just out of sight. Something he missed. And just like trying to
focus on dim objects blanched by overpowering light, he knew if he concentrated
too long on what was bothering him, nothing would come. So he'd glance at it
sideways, hoping whatever he missed would emerge from obscurity and reveal
itself in due course. He took another sip of his wine and wondered how it was
possible for anyone in his right mind to be a vegetarian with that kind of
smell floating about. He smiled to himself. It had occurred to him on more than
one occasion that perfume-makers were probably missing out on a fortune in
sales by avoiding the obvious: steak-scented perfume. He could picture the ad: <i>Ladies,
you want to bring out the carnivore in your man? Send him into a feeding frenzy
with T-bone After Dark.</i> He shook his head and laughed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Papa?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah toddled to
her grandfather and looked up. She was a beautiful little girl: blonde hair, a
perpetually messy face, large green eyes, and a joyous laugh that made everyone
around her smile. And she idolized her papa. She looked at him with awe and
wonder. He was, after all, one of those guys who wore a badge and got to chase
bad guys with his <i>shoot gun</i>. Just like on television. She crouched a
little and got into a playful stance meant to communicate to her grandfather
she was ready to play the catch-me-if-you-can game. Of course, he always did.
He was fast for an old guy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Two …. Go!" She
squealed, and ran away from Tobias, looking back all the way to ensure he was
following. Tobias placed his wine on the patio and bolted from his chair. In
less than five steps he grabbed her and scooped her high into the air. She
shrieked with delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Papa! You always
catch me too fast!" She admonished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, maybe you
need faster shoes, pumpkin!" He replied, tickling Sarah as she kicked and
squealed in his arms. As he was about to put her down for a best of two out of
three, a muffled buzz interrupted their play, announcing an incoming call. He
really didn't want to answer, but, being lead detective, he guessed he probably
didn't have much of a choice. Something about open murder cases the brass up
top didn't like. He put Sarah down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just a moment,
sweetie. Anne?" Anne walked from a small crowd that included her mother, her
husband, a couple of their neighbors, and the family dog. Sarah fussed a bit,
not wanting to part from her grandpa, but Anne offered her a cookie, which
quickly refocused her attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tobias." He said,
somehow angry about receiving a call he should have expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yo, Tobias! How's
the picnic with the family?" Sanchez sounded happy, and Tobias was pretty sure
why: the kid knew family gatherings decompressed him, made the following work
week much less anal than usual. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Great, Sanchez.
Wish you could be here. Whatcha got?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> "Nothing at all
El Capitan!" Sanchez replied joyfully. "We got zero. Whoever took out Mr.
Hassenback did a really good job covering his ass!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, I guess we
expected that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's good news, though,
right boss?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I guess. We still
have some open roads to go down on this one, though, kid."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Can't we just
chalk this one up to natural causes? We can say he just slipped and twisted his
neck."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sanchez, have you
been drinking?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Naw, but if you
got some burgers left, I'll consider drinking some of that nasty old red wine
with you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, come on
over. We got plenty. We can talk a little shop about this case, too.
Something's been bothering me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Something's
always bothering you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This is a little different.
I think we may have overlooked something. How close are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just happen to be
pulling into your driveway as we speak. See you in less than one minute. Out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias slapped his
phone shut, put it in his pocket, then found his daughter and reclaimed his
granddaughter. With Sarah in his arms, he walked through the sliding glass door
at the rear of his two-story Victorian house, through the kitchen, and made his
way to the front of the house just as the doorbell rang. He pulled the door
open and greeted his partner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez saw Tobias
had Sarah so he made a show of flashing his badge and saying, "Officer Sanchez
reporting for duty, sir!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah looked at
Sanchez and giggled. "Uncle Juan, you're silly!" She raised her arms up and was
unceremoniously transferred from grandfather to adopted uncle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Sanchez carried
Sarah into the house, Tobias closed the door and glanced down at the bank of
light switches on the wall next to the coat closet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Light
switches,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Pardon?" Sanchez
replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Light switches."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What about them,
boss? You okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You ever have
that thing happen to you where you're in the kitchen trying to find some sugar
for your coffee and you just can't?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, when it's
right there in front of you but you can't see it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. Light
switches. I'm thinking about light switches right now. Something about them is
bothering me. It's right there for me, but I just can't reach it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked
again at the bank of switches. The fog cleared a little and the obvious
implication burst through him with sweeping clarity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're going to
have to grab something on the road, son. We have to go now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay." Sanchez
replied, as if he were half expecting for the evening to be derailed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was a reaction
Tobias had come to expect from the kid. He'd always incorporated a little Zen
into his detective work, letting the scenes pose the questions themselves
instead of forcing issues. He found it an efficient way to process them. But he
also found the answers sometimes came to him at less-than-convenient times.
Like now. But that didn't seem to bother Sanchez. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Are you going to
tell me what got your attention?" Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tell you in the
car. Maybe we can get there and back before anybody notices we're gone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd ensured Carri
got home safely, then returned to his weekly and immediately put on a pot of
coffee. Some pot. It had enough capacity for two cups. Certainly not enough to
push him into the early hours of the morning, and from the amount of data he had
in front of him, he fully expected it to be a long night. He'd given some
thought to purchasing a decent coffee maker from one of those full service
retail stores, but he figured the trouble of setting it up wherever he went and
keeping it in his truck when he was without a place to stay made the
convenience more of a pain than anything else. As he waited for the noisy
little machine to belch out its brew, he sat down at the table and considered
the work in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It might seem
counterintuitive, but he'd learned from experience long ago that jumping
straight into an image search was unproductive. Most pedophiles had gigabytes
of images and videos stored on their drives, and gigabytes more deleted, sent
to their grave in an electronic circle of life: stars would fall out of favor,
failing to elicit the sexual high they once had, to be replaced by newer, more
appealing images. But the deleted files weren't really gone. Far from it. In
his former life, Clark had demonstrated that to his students every year in his
Introduction to Computer Forensics class. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The lifecycle of
an electronic file isn't complicated: it starts and ends on the hard drive,
placed there by its read-write heads under the direction of the operating
system. The file is typically broken into many parts and scattered over the
surface of the hard drive, embedded into areas called sectors. The operating
system knows how to retrieve the disjointed file because its parts are entered
in something called the File Allocation Table (FAT), which keeps the name of
the file and the address of the sectors in which it is contained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When a file is
deleted, it isn't destroyed. It's simply renamed in the FAT, it's former name
prefixed by a special character that tells the operating system the file is no
longer needed and may be written over. The contents of the file, though, remain
on the hard drive, and there it will stay until a process such as
defragmentation writes over it completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Defragmenting
optimizes a hard drive by moving files around on its platters so they occupy
contiguous sectors. In other words, instead of being scattered all over the
hard drive, the logical pieces that make up the file are placed side-by-side in
neat little data chains. This makes access to the files quicker, as the read
write head doesn't have to move all over the hard drive just to retrieve them.
The rewriting of the files during a defrag, especially if the hard drive is
already quite full, writes over sectors marked for deletion, and this
effectively removes most traces of any potentially unwanted garbage. If the
hard drive is not so full, then a defrag won't do much to destroy the scattered
pieces of the deleted files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Every time he
gave the lecture, Clark's students would offer up their opinion that formatting
a hard drive would remove all traces of all files. But this is not the case,
either. Most of the time, formatting simply resets the File Allocation Table,
leaving the sectors behind for potential forensic inspection. He'd always end
his lectures on file durability by admonishing that there were really only two
ways to absolutely remove them from a hard drive: one, fill it with random
garbage until every sector on the drive is used in its entirety; or, two,
simply destroy the drive. If the goal is to destroy all of the data on a hard
drive, demolishing it is the best option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A comprehensive
image search, then, not only implicates files recognized by the FAT, it
implicates an exploration of the graveyard of previously-deleted files as well.
Which means interrogating every single sector of a hard drive with a piece of
software that will put them back together, much like dozens of paper documents,
ripped to shreds, might be taped together to get as close to their original
state as possible. And a search like that using his equipment could take days.
But there are other ways to start file searches without having to interrogate
them directly. Clark had found searching text-based material on storage media
was a much more efficient way to begin his forensic work. It was faster, gave
him more meaningful information, and typically pointed him to specific images
that had relevance with respect to his investigation. He connected the imaged
drive to his laptop, then entered his first-pass keyword search list: <i>meet,
attractive, young, conference, location, contact, organizer, goal, plan, safe,
legitimate, investment, opportunity, review, asset, mature, plan, market,
years, old, entertain, return, fresh, in-house, guarantee, private, host, and
any occurrences of the numbers zero through 255</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark clicked the
search icon, got up from the flimsy two dollar chair the weekly had somehow
declared furniture, went to a rickety dresser that doubled as a kitchen table,
and poured himself his first cup of coffee. As his laptop crunched and churned,
his thoughts unexpectedly turned to Carri. He'd regretted his encounter with
Chuck, but in the end, he was glad he'd been there to help out. If he hadn't
been, he was certain Carri would have wound up in the hospital, or worse. Chuck
was clearly a jealous ex who wanted nothing more than to subjugate or hurt her.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd spotted Chuck
about ten minutes after they'd begun their caravan toward Carri's home. The
girls decided to take Lisa's car to help deflect Chuck's attention in case he
followed, adding reasonable confusion regarding who was in the vehicle and
where they were heading. As soon as Clark had spotted him, he'd slowed and
allowed the girls to pass. He then lagged behind them, placing himself midway
between their vehicle and Chuck's in a one-mile long caravan. Fortunately,
Carri appeared to live somewhere off Foothill Blvd, which narrowed to two lanes
as it approached Crescenta Highlands. Clark had been hoping for a lane
reduction, and as soon as it happened, he stepped on his brakes, honked once,
and flashed his high-beams to message the girls to keep going. As he slowed to
35 miles per hour, Chuck raced forward, preparing to pass. Clark swerved left,
denied passage. Chuck slowed, regrouped, tried to pass again, but Clark
positioned his vehicle to prevent Chuck from going around him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The only thing
that had made Clark a little nervous about this new interaction with Chuck was
the possibility catching the attention of a police cruiser, which was the last
thing he needed. As in the bar, Clark had no reason to fear the man following
him. Chuck certainly had the faster vehicle: he drove a newer-model Ford
Mustang, pimped out in low-profile tires, chrome wheels, tinted windows, and a
bright yellow paint job. The overall presentation of the car exuded oozed
compensation for some personal deficiency on the part of the driver. Clark, on
the other hand, drove a 1996 F150. His ride was certainly not as fast as
Chuck's, but in the event of an accidental or intentional collision, he liked
his chances. Clark gave a quick tug on his seatbelt to ensure he was properly
belted in, glanced in his rear view mirror, then slowed down a little more.
Chuck slowed to match his speed, then, after another mile, finally stopped,
turned around, and headed off in the other direction. Clark finally allowed
himself to focus on what was ahead of him and saw the reason for Chuck's change
of heart: the girls were no longer in sight, more than likely lost in a maze of
neighborhood streets or perhaps even garaged. Chuck knew his chances for
finding them were almost zero, so he had abandoned the chase. Clark continued
on Foothill Avenue until it hooked up with the 210, then headed back to his
weekly, arriving there a little after nine in the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark finished his
cup of coffee, poured himself another, and returned to his computer. It had not
completed searching the files and emails on the imaged drive, but it already
had a list of over three dozen hits. Clark scrolled through them, selected one
that looked promising, and began reading.</p>
