<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark drove in no
particular direction, his only objective being to get as far away from
Eduardo's apartment as possible. He had his left hand on the wheel of the
Mustang, his right held his open, pay-as-you-go cell. He punched in a seven-digit
exchange and pressed send. To his surprise, the phone picked up after the first
ring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;This is
Joe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The number may have
been local, but the voice on the other end betrayed a heavy Louisiana accent,
sent Clark back the better part of a decade. His mind flooded with memories of
a young black man who'd come to him during his freshman year in college looking
for advice about which classes he should take to get him up to speed for the
computer-related coursework Clark taught at the college. Joe was about 21 at
the time, he and his brother fresh from New Orleans, sent to LA by their mother
in a desperate attempt to remove them from the gang activity both had fallen
into. They had been sent to live with an uncle who resided just outside of
Orange County. The uncle was not rich by any means, but he was in a good
neighborhood, and he understood the plight of his sister all too well. He'd
taken them in, no questions asked. In the end, Joe had made it, picked himself
up by his bootstraps and made himself a better life. His brother Jerry, on the
other hand, didn't. He quickly fell in with a local branch of the Crips, picked
up right where he'd left off in New Orleans. It was Jerry he wanted to talk to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, Joe, this is
Clark. Remember me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark?&quot; Pause.
&quot;How are you doing these days?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He could hear the
concern in Joe's voice. He could hear an inflection of hope there, too. Hope
delivered by a former student and a friendship borne out of the collegiate bond
that sometimes forms between teacher and student. Joe had been to both
funerals, had even offered him a room after he sold his house. It was a bad
time, though. And he really didn't want to spread his misery around. He needed
to deal with the loss in his own way, so he'd declined the offer. Joe had tried
to call several times after, but Clark never picked up, never returned the
calls. The reason was simple, in his mind, anyway: the second he'd walked out
of the cemetery, the second after he'd put his wife in the ground, he'd vowed
revenge. He knew, too, the path he chose to take would be a bloody one. He
couldn't bring someone like Joe into that, not after the kid had worked so damn
hard to get out of trouble. He checked his mental wandering, snapped himself
back to the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm doing okay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Still going to
the DoJo?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was a sideways
question, a backdoor interrogative regarding his mental health. Joe had always
understood Clark as a guy who needed to engage in heavy physical activity to be
level and happy. He knew this because he'd trained Clark for the better part of
five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Training at
home.. I'm keeping up on it.&quot; The reply was unintentionally terse, the
conversation awkward and a little mechanical, the way they always get after a
couple of years of silence. There's really no grease to make the words flow
more steadily, no rehearsal for what he had to ask of his friend. He wanted to
find a way to ask the favor without getting the kid caught up in what he was
doing, to hide his intention behind a mask that would somehow keep him completely
uninvolved. Safe. But there was not solution to this one, so he decided on a
semi-direct route:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How's your
brother doing these days?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another pause. This
time rooted in shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jerry? He's doing
okay, I guess. Why do you ask?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Listen, Joe, I
need to see him. I really need you to get me in touch with him as soon as you
can.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Whoa. Wait. Why?
The guy's nothing but trouble, Clark. Hell, he's so bad I barely talk to him.
What do you need from a guy like that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I just need to
see him, Joe. It's very important.&quot; Clark let the phone drop off his ear
for a moment. He knew there'd be another pause. A long one. One of the things
he really admired about Joe was his innate ability to assess, calculate, and
conclude. His last two statements would have moved right around anyone else,
drifted past a careless listener like an apparition wafting through the air.
But Joe looks for motivation in everything. Given the circumstances, a bizarre
request borne out of the only obvious motivation on Clark's part, Joe made the
correct conclusion in less than a minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You can't do
that, man. It's crazy. If you know where the sonofabitch is, I'm begging you,
get the police involved. Let them take the bastard down. You can't ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark cut him off.
&quot;Can't do that, Joe. Look, I don't want to get you involved any more than
getting me in touch with Jerry. I don't really want to get him involved,
either. I just need him to point me in a direction. That's all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Joe.&quot; Slight
pause. &quot;This one's not God's. It's not going to be for the justice system,
either. I made a promise. To both of them. This one's mine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another pause, then a
tone of resignation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I guess it
is. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing myself. Call me in an hour. I'll give
you a place where we can meet. We can go from there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't want you
involved, Joe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's the only way
it's going to happen, bro. My brother doesn't know you, so you're definitely
going to need me there. One hour. Okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark reluctantly
agreed, then slapped his phone shut. During the conversation, he'd somehow
managed to drive his way up toward Glendale. The air in the mustang was on, but
the car was stifling hot. And he was thirsty. He pulled into a gas station,
picked up a liter of water for about the same price he could buy a gallon in a
supermarket, paid the attendant, and returned to the car. The seatbacks seared
his shoulders as he leaned back into the hot leather. He opened his water and
took down almost half the bottle with three deep gulps. He stared out the front
of the car, found himself fiddling with the radio receiver. He looked at the
phone, then back at the water bottle, then back at the phone again. He started
the car and flipped the air onto full blast. He took another gulp of water,
then looked at the phone once again. He had one more call to make, and he knew
he was stalling. He really didn't want to make the call, but he had to. The
scene at Eduardo's apartment complex demanded it. He flipped open his phone and
dialed another local exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez had
worked quickly to sort through Eduardo's mail, keeping only items that looked
like bills or statements. They then allowed themselves a quick search of the
apartment for any further evidence of additional bank accounts or credit cards.
After twenty minutes of looking, Tobias decided they'd probably find nothing
else and called off the search.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;There's nothing
else here,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave Tobias a
puzzled look. &quot;Doesn't look like it. But we haven't searched the whole
place yet, either.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No time. We need
to call this in. We're starting to get into a murky area here: manager's got an
arrival time for us, and the difference between that and our call time is
getting a little long. Probably already too long, but not enough to cause too
many raised eyebrows.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, want me to
notify the manager he's gonna have a crime scene on his hands?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. Probably a
good idea. You do that and I'll call this in. Don't forget to tell him we're
going to need the names of the tenants in the adjacent units and the parking
out front is going to be cramped for a while.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias followed Sanchez
down the flight of stairs to ground level. As Sanchez turned the corner toward
the apartment office, Tobias walked straight to his car. The first thing he did
was get on the radio to call in the 187; he then dialed Lieutenant Dursk,
hoping he was still searching the files on The Orange Network servers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Dursk.&quot; The
gravelly voice rasped through the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tobias. How are
things coming?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We're wrapping
up. Not a whole lot here besides what we found initially. I hope it helps. Did
you find your guy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias sighed.
&quot;Our unknown got to him first. He seems to be one step ahead of us, but I
think we may be closing the gap. Problem is, we only have one reasonable route
left, and if we exhaust that without results, we're probably done for a
while.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I was
afraid of that. After you left, I thought about what you said. It all sunk in,
so I'm really not surprised at what you found. I do have something for you,
though: the email exchanges after Hassenback's death were about a banking
opportunity. So if you're right about that being a front of the child peddlers,
then that's what most of  their conversation focused on. Bottom line: since
Eduardo's dead, we can assume this guy's got the information he needs, knows
where this place is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yep. And now it's
a foot race, and we haven't even started running yet. But you told me exactly
what I needed to hear. I need you to do me a favor: fax all of the
correspondences to Robert Michaels up at the Pasadena Superior Court. I'm about
to make a call to the guy and ask for a warrant to gain access to Eduardo's
transactional history at his bank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not a problem.
I'll get that out right now. I'm not giving you good odds on that angle,
though, Tobias. A facility like that is most definitely cash-only.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Understood. But
he had to drive to get there. I'm going to bet it's a fair distance from LA.
With any luck, maybe he needed gas or picked up a meal somewhere nearby.
Anyhow, while it's definitely a long shot, it's all I got right now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias ended the call,
then dialed the number for the Superior Court of Pasadena. After a brief
exchange with the secretary, he got through to Michaels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Michaels.&quot;
The falsetto voice sounded tinny, like an AM radio over the cell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sir, this is
Detective Tobias. I was your 7:30 this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, detective.
Search warrant net you anything?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it did.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, very good.
How else may I be of service?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I need another
warrant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Did this
...&quot; Michaels paused. Tobias heard the slight sound of paper being
shuffled around. &quot;Eduardo. Did this Eduardo fellow give you enough
information for me to issue an additional warrant?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No, sir. The
condition in which we found him precluded such an elaboration.&quot; He said it
with a little irritation, brought about by fatigue and the feeling a runner
gets when he comes in second during a big race. The pause in the conversation
made him regret his tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What do you mean,
detective?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He's dead. We
have no ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels interrupted,
incredulous. &quot;He's dead? Same perp?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No doubt.
Identical M.O.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels let out a low,
wet whistle. &quot;No shit?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;There's more.
Turns out Eduardo had an exchange of emails with Hassenback when Hassenback was
being processed by the morgue. The content of the emails specifically centered
on interest in the facility behind the phony marketing literature sent to
Hassenback by Eduardo. Ergo, our unknown now has information about the location
of this facility. The particulars of the exchange itself should either be on
their way or at your office right now. I just had them faxed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;And this is going
to be the basis for a warrant against whom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;First National
Bank of California. I want to take a look at Eduardo's transactional history.
It's a long shot, but it might give us an indication as to where this facility
is. Right now, it's the only trail we have.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This time, Michaels
surprised Tobias, offered no resistance or skepticism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, you were
right on the money about Eduardo, detective, so who am I to deny you access to
a transactional history? Drop by in about an hour to pick it up.&quot; Michaels
paused, then said, &quot;Oh, and by the way, can you do me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sure,&quot; said
Tobias, a little perplexed at what he might be able to do for Michaels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Next time you get
a case like this, could you spread things out a little bit so I'm not typing up
all of your affidavits <i>and</i> your search warrants?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias shared tired
chuckle with Michaels, then disconnected. As he placed his phone in his pocket,
he noticed Sanchez walking back toward him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Everythink
okay?&quot; He asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Obviously, he's
not happy. He's looking up the names of the adjacent tenants now, said he'll
bring them to us in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He'll bring them
to <i>you</i>. You're going to stay here and help control the scene and make
certain we didn't miss anything. I need to go back downtown to the courthouse
and pick up another search warrant. From there, I'm going straight to the
bank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias's voice trailed
at the end, and Sanchez gave him a look. Neither of them had much sleep over
the past couple of days, Tobias especially, and the young officer's expression
obviously questioned how much longer the detective was going to be able to
operate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You going to be
okay to drive? If you don't want to do the running around, I can go pick up the
warrant and run to the bank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's okay, kid.
I'm fine. Warrant's in my name, anyway. &quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias got in his
cruiser, closed the door, started the engine, and then rolled down the
driver's-side window. He waved Sanchez over, then said, &quot;One more
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, Detective
Columbo?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;See if Mr. Ruez
has a manifest of the vehicles allowed to park here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You think our guy
still might be here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I really doubt
it. Better to be thorough, though. On the outside chance you rolled up right as
he was walking out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The phone picked up on
the second ring, a pleasant-sounding female voice answering. A familiar voice.
The voice of an angel. Or the nearest thing to it as far as Clark could tell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark paused, tried to
collect his thoughts. How many people should he get involved with his problem?
He figured only two. That was the upper bound for the possible answers he had
to that question. He really only knew two people in the area. Two people who
were important to him, anyway. Sure, he'd get others involved, but they really
didn't count. Those were people who committed heinous crimes on a daily basis.
He couldn't get them in any more trouble than they had already gotten
themselves into. But adding innocent people into his plan didn't sit well with
him, placed a dull ache in the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As much as he didn't
want to get her involved, though, he knew he had to talk to her. He had, after
all, just killed her ex-husband; and as soon as the body was found, the police
would be called, they'd build their interview list, and she'd be on it. So she
had to be ready for that. And he needed her assistance, too. If his hunch was
correct, the police probably already knew who he was and what he was doing. In
other words, this was now a race to the desert, and he had to prepare for it,
beat them to it. To accomplish that, he'd have to be at different locations
simultaneously over the next several hours, and last time he checked that was
impossible. Whether he liked it or not, he needed help, just a little, to
provide him just enough inertia to push through to the end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hello?&quot; She
asked again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, Carri, it's
Clark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jack?&quot; She
asked, not attempting to hide either her surprise or delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. I really
need to talk to you. It's important. It's also imperative we talk somewhere
where we'll not be overheard.&quot; He didn't mean to, but he spoke each
sentence deliberately, placing a significant pause between each.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You can come to
my place. You still have the address?&quot; The excitement in her voice leveled
off, diminished by the concern brought about by his request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes. When are you
off work?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Actually, I took
the day off to take care of some things around the house. You want to come over
now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark did a quick
calculation. He expected Joe to call in a little under an hour. With a ten
minute drive to Carri's, that gave him about 45 minutes to talk to her.
Probably ten minutes to tell her what he'd done to Chuck, followed by another
half hour describing what he needed from her. He had no doubt she would take
the news about her ex with equanimity. For years, she'd been forced to go out
of her way to adjust her life to avoid the man. He'd put her in the hospital
several times, and Clark knew if he hadn't killed Chuck, the man would've
probably eventually killed her. No doubt he would have killed her. After what
Clark heard him say, it was only a matter of time. Now she'd have the freedom
to move about as she pleased. She wouldn't have to worry about Chuck anymore.
The rationale made sense to him, but he wondered if he was fooling himself.
Understanding and anticipating the behavior of a man had always come easy for
him, but he'd never fully understood how women thought, figured the differences
in thinking and motivation had to be rooted at an atomic level, a place he just
couldn't get to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You still
there?&quot; Her voice was soft, velvety in his ear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, sorry. I'll
come right over. Can you do me a favor, though?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You promise? This
is really important.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes. I
promise.&quot; Her voice pitched up a notch, betraying a slight amount of
stress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I want you to
stay in an interior room. Don't stand at a window or out front waiting for me
to arrive. Come to the door only when I knock. Can you do that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. I guess.
What's this all about, Jack?&quot; The slight tinge in her voice spilled out
with a nervousness Clark caught with a little trepidation of his own. He
couldn't have her waiting for him only to see Chuck's car roll up. She'd
definitely panic, maybe even call the police.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can you trust me
on this? I promise you I'll explain when I get there.&quot; He did his best to
say it softly, reassuringly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri sighed. &quot;I
can do that. But it's a weird request all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know. I
apologize. I'll see you in ten minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark hung up the
phone, started the Mustang, and headed down the road, wondering the whole way
whether he'd made the right decision to involve Carri.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The trip to the
courthouse had taken less than a half hour, but Tobias was more than a little
concerned about having to wait another thirty minutes for the paperwork. The
thought of making small talk with Michaels' anachronistic secretary didn't
bother him too much. Actually, he figured a short conversation might help him
fight what he was really worried about: dozing off in the reception area. He
knew if he fell asleep there, they'd have to call someone to pick him up. His
body felt like lead, and every movement he made felt as it were through Jell-O rather
than air. To his surprise, the warrant was waiting for him when he arrived,
delivered by the codgy secretary herself, who was wearing something Abe
Lincoln's wife might have gone bananas over. He told her to thank Michaels for
the quick work; she responded with a curt nod that told him she'd relay the
message. Twenty minutes later he was at the main branch of the First National
Bank of California.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He entered the bank,
found Eduardo's transaction history was already waiting for him, all tucked
neatly into a large, yellow envelope. The clerk who'd handed it over told him
in a hushed, confidential voice some heavy from the courthouse named Michaels
had phoned in ahead, said a warrant was on the way, and the information was
time-sensitive. So the bank had put a priority on running the report, feeling
it was their duty to help the police expedite their mission. Tobias just gave
the guy a tired smile, handed him the a copy of the warrant, thanked him, and
left, grateful for the additional surprise granted by his friend at the
courthouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He beat a baked path
back to his cruiser, the hot sun pushing down on him as he walked, bathing him
in a sleepy warmth that decimated his focus, threatening to lull him to sleep.
He opened the door to his car, was pleased to find the interior had kept a
remnant of the coolness the air conditioner had blasted out on his way to the
bank. He closed the door quickly to keep the heat out, started the car, then
flipped open his phone to call Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, boss.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How's going out
there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Got a D-II here
who thinks he's God's gift. Didn't really want me around until I told him who I
was working with. That changed his attitude slightly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's the
detective's name?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Guy named
Blevens. Looks kind of like Mr. Belvedere on Steroids. Why do people dress like
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias chuckled.
&quot;Yeah, he can be an ass at times, but he's pretty good. He waiting for
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He's started the
preliminaries, but, yeah, he said he wanted to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Scene's no
different from Hassenback's, really. Tell him I said so. In fact, tell him I'll
have someone from the precinct deliver the Hassenback file I worked so he can
use it for background, cross reference it with what he finds to definitively
link the two crimes as being the work of the same actor. Unless we caught this
guy in the middle of something, though, he's not going to find squat in that
apartment. Just a db, some missing computer equipment, and a clean floor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was a pause in
the conversation, Tobias understood Sanchez was using it to write everything he
said in his notebook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Anything else,
boss?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. Tell
Blevens this one's his. I got the transactional history from the bank. He
doesn't need to know about that yet. I'm going to take it home, get a glass of
wine, and work my way through it. I had no idea a report detailing a year's
worth of deposits and withdraws could generate so much damn paper.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Got it. By the
way, the apartment manager does make the tenants register the vehicles they
park on the grounds with the office here. I have a guy checking all the plates
against the list now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good work. See
that part though. Let me know if you come up with anything. When you're done,
come on out to the house. You can help me work though all this bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Roger that. Any
chance for some of those world-famous burgers tonight? Nobody cooks that stuff
up better than Carol.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think there's a
distinct possibility. Listen, I need to go take a cold shower. Maybe that'll
wake me up enough to get through Eduardo's banking history. I bet the whole
state of California didn't have this many transactions last year. How much
longer do you have with respect to vehicle elimination?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;At our current
rate? Probably about an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. See you
then, kid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias slapped his
phone shut, worked hard to keep his eyes open and focused on the road. He knew
a cold shower would do him good, would revitalize him, give him the energy he
needed for a couple of more hours of work. As he drove north away from LA, he
knew for certain the day couldn't get much longer. Another few hours, and he'd
be asleep. It wouldn't matter what he was doing. He'd just nod off and be done
with the exhaustion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark exited the gas
station parking lot, followed West Woodbury Road to the 210, and merged into
its comparatively light north-LA traffic. As he made his way toward the
Foothills Blvd exit, he hoped Carri had listened to him and kept to an interior
room. He knew the request on its surface was ridiculous, but it was still the
right thing to ask: no doubt she wouldn't be able to make him out behind the
tinted windows of the Mustang when he rolled up, no doubt she would panic, no
doubt she would call the police out of fear for her safety. As he headed up
Foothill Blvd, he tried to rehearse what he was going to say to her. As with
Joe, however, there was simply no easy way, no shortcut for delivering the
news. He took at a crumpled piece of paper from his shirt pocket that detailed
where she lived. The instructions told him to take a left on Santa Carlotta
Street. A minute later, he was parked in front of light yellow, stucco home,
the top of which was roofed with an expensive Spanish tile. It had a three car
garage, a high fence surrounding the backyard, mature trees and shrubs
decorated the front yard and both sides of the driveway. He exited the
vehicle, then gave his shirt a good tug to ensure the gun in the small of his
back wasn't protruding. He made his way up the driveway, followed a tiled path
to the front door of the house, and rang the buzzer. Carri answered the door a
moment later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jack! Good to see
you again!&quot; She smiled, eyes plainly displaying pleasure. &quot;I kept to
a back room like you said. I still don't understand the request, though.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said nothing,
just stood patiently in front of the entryway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri smiled and
blushed. &quot;Oh, sorry! Come in please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She stepped back from
the door while holding it open. Clark entered the home, walked through a
conservative foyer with closets on the left and right, a tasteful hanging
chandelier, and white sandstone flooring. The Foyer opened into a quaint,
old-fashioned living room that sported solid oak floors and an assortment of
older, clearly-adopted furniture. While the furnishings hadn't been purchased
as a set, the eclectic collection produced a harmony that reminded him of his
parent's farmhouse. The whole orchestration gave him an instant feeling of
country living with a highly Spartan inflection. As he stood in the middle of
the living room, Carri closed the door, then walked up to him, stood so close
he could smell the perfume on her, feel her breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hi.&quot; She
said, not bothering to hide the obvious flirtation. Her mouth was curled at the
edges, her eyes beaming with brightness. Clark once gain found himself captivated
by her, found himself more comfortable than he'd been in years. But he knew he
couldn't allow himself the luxury of comfort. Not yet. Maybe not ever. He took
a deep, inconspicuous breath, held it, then let it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think you
should probably have a seat, Carri.&quot; He said it as gently as he could,
knew the weird requests on his part were beginning to stack up like dirty
dishes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri gave Clark a
quizzical look, the half smile and the dance in her eyes all but gone,
supplanted by a more sober countenance. She backed to her sofa, sat, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's
wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't answer
immediately, just took out Chuck's keys and threw them to her. She caught them
one-handed and looked at them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You recognize
those?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. Should
I?&quot; She looked again at the keys, then set them on the stone coffee table
in front of her. She tucked her feet under her legs, and continued to stare up
at the big man in front of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;They're
Chuck's.&quot; His words hung in the air for a moment. She looked even more
confused. After a long pause, she said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jack, what are
you doing with Chuck's keys?&quot; She appeared to be thinking about the
mixture of possibilities, which changed her look from confusion to concern to
fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't know of
any other way to say this to you, Carri. He's dead. I killed him.&quot; The
final two sentences hit the air like a shot, the concussion of which knocked
Carri off center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Her voice changed, moved up in pitch but markedly quieter.
&quot;What do you mean you <i>killed</i> Chuck?&quot; This time barely above a
throaty whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark knew he cut an
imposing figure, especially when standing in front of a seated, petite woman
who was clearly frightened. So he crouched down in front of her, made sure his
eye level was the same as hers. He softened his voice, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He tried to kill
me, Carri. With this.&quot; He took the gun from the small of his back. Carri
flinched at the sight, brought her knees up to her chest to make herself small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh my God, Jack.
No! Why? Oh my God. Why? What happened?&quot; The words just spilled out, then
stopped. She looked straight at Clark, her eyes got wide, and then she let out
a choked, plaintive yell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark remained where he
was, motionless, frozen by the reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri took her arms
from around her knees and placed both hands to her face, employing them to wipe
away the torrent of tears streaming out of the corners of her eyes and down her
cheeks. Her breathing became ragged, interrupted irregularly by a soft choking
sound. They  maintained their positions for a good five minutes, Clark soldered
to the floor, Carri on the couch crying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot;
he said. &quot;He wanted to kill me. I really had no choice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You think I'm
crying for Chuck?&quot; She let out a choked laugh and then cried even harder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I guess I don't
really know,&quot; he said softly. &quot;The last thing I wanted to do was hurt
you.&quot; He meant it too. He'd killed Chuck so the bastard wouldn't have any
avenue to hurt her after his business in the desert was complete. She had done
something very special for him that night in his room: she had stayed with him,
held him, supplied emotional footings when his were about to give. For that he
owed her a lot, perhaps even his life. For that he'd never forget her, always
be in debt to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri got up from the
couch and again walked right up to him. He stood. As she approached, he could
see the despondence spilling out of her, pressing her down and wreaking havoc
on her every movement. She looked down at the gun in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Could you please
put that down.&quot; The words came out spasmodically, hacked to the verge of
incomprehension by receding sobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark looked at this
left hand, noticed the gun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sorry.&quot; He
placed the Colt on the coffee table, then returned his attention to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri stepped closer,
wrapping her arms around his midsection, placing her head just above his
sternum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Oh, Jack.&quot;
She took a deep breath, then spoke quickly. &quot;I couldn't care less about
Chuck. Really, I couldn't. After all he's put me through? He deserved what he
got, the bastard. This is the last thing <i>you</i> need, though. When I saw
you last ... those things you told me. Those horrible, horrible things. I would
have stayed. I wanted to stay. After holding you all night, all I wanted to do
was hold you more. But I thought you needed space. So I left, and I didn't want
to leave. But I did. I wanted you to call. I kept thinking about you. I
couldn't work I thought about you so much. And then you called. And I was so
happy. And you tell me this. I don't care about Chuck. You see? I care about
you! And what if you're caught? You might go to jail and I might not ever see
you ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Shhh.&quot; Clark
whispered. He lowered his head and gently kissed the nape of her neck. She
turned her face to meet his and gave him a soft kiss. He wanted to kiss her
more. He wanted to kiss her harder. He <i>wanted</i> her. But he couldn't. It
wouldn't be fair. Not with the business at hand. So he brought his hands to her
shoulders, massive paws that eclipsed any hint of what was under them. He
pushed her slightly away and looked at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I feel the same
way. I do. But I can't.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I understand. I'm
sorry.&quot; She bent her head down, tears once again beginning to build and
flow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. You <i>don't</i>
understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She looked up at him
quickly, her ponytail bobbing behind her as she did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. I think you
better sit down again, Carri. There's something else about me you need to
know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias was seated at
his kitchen table. He could definitely say he felt refreshed after having taken
a cold shower, but he didn't feel reinvigorated. He'd been up for more than
thirty hours, still felt exhausted, felt he probably had another few hours in
him before he simply involuntarily shut down. He stared at the paperwork in
front of him. There were two piles. The pile on the left held Eduardo's
transactional history. It was a good inch thick, most of it populated with
trivial purchases of less than five dollars. He felt a little acid move up his
esophagus, where it pooled and burned. He shook his head at none one, figured
if Eduardo were still alive, he'd kill him himself for being such a sloppy
spender and putting him through such a monumental inconvenience. Who puts 89
cents on a debit card for a pack of gum? Really?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The pile on the right
was a much smaller stack. It contained keys for the storefronts on the other
side of Eduardo's transaction history. It was full of business names,
addresses, and phone numbers. The bank had been thorough in giving him all they
could, but he thought it was too bad they couldn't combine the reports somehow
so he wouldn't have to do all that cross-referencing. Just as he was about to
think of another way he could posthumously kill Eduardo, Carol walked to the
table holding two glasses of wine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You read my
mind!&quot; He said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're tired,
dear. You should just go upstairs to bed. You can drink your wine while I give
you a nice massage. You can do all this tomorrow, right?&quot; She waved one of
her wine-filled hands at the mess on the table in front of her, then handed one
of the glasses to him, told him it was a Reserve Zinfandel. He retrieved the
glass, placed it to his lips, and took a deep sip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks, sweetie.
No can do on the sleep. This has turned into a foot race, and this ...&quot; He
pointed to the stack of papers in front of him &quot;...  may be our only
chance at winning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol bent down and
kissed Tobias on the top of the head, then moved to the front of his face and
gave him a gentle kiss on the lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then at least let
me help you, Toby Bear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Her lips lingered.
Tobias could smell her coconut lotion. He adored the scent, knew she mostly
wore it to wear down his defenses, make him a helpless captive to her every
whim. But tonight she'd brought him wine and called him by his pet name, which
meant she was concerned and wanted to help him out with whatever was causing
him difficulty. He was glad for the help, but he wouldn't mind being held
captive by her, either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. Sounds like
a good deal to me.&quot; He smiled, took another sip of his wine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Slow down, dear.
That's not water.&quot; She said flatly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He waved her to the
chair opposite his, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The stack on your
right contains a year's worth of banking transactional history for a dead guy
named Eduardo Gutierrez. We need to go through the stack, look for transactions
larger than forty dollars, and then figure out which of those transactions
occurred the furthest away from our fair city. That's where the stack on your
left comes in. It contains business contact information for keys associated
with each of the items on the right. That stack is going to tell us where the
guy was when he made each of these purchases.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carol gave Tobias a
mock-lustful look, said, &quot;God I love it when you talk to me like
that!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias chuckled but
said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. Why don't I
alphabetize the business list while you go through with a yellow marker a find
all of the transactions over forty? Then once I get this pile in order, you can
call out the names of the businesses and I can tell you where they are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds
great!&quot; He said, meaning it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias started rifling
through Eduardo's transactional history while Carol, scissors in hand, started
slicing out the business entities and arranging them in a neat pile. At first, 
he didn't understand the scissors approach, but as he made his way through his
own list, he noticed the same business codes coming up over and over. He
figured most of them were probably from establishments right around where
Eduardo lived, represented businesses they wouldn't be interested in. Instead
of going through the list over and over, Carol set up a strategy that would
allow her to simply throw the local businesses into a different pile, making
her search more efficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The work went more
quickly than he expected. Of the 5,436 transactions in his file, only 230 were
for purchases of more than forty dollars. Tobias shook his head and quickly
fantasized about beating Eduardo over the head with an over-sized calculator.
Carol had finished with her part about an hour before him, so she'd left to go
read or watch the news or take the dog for a walk. He couldn't remember.
Numbers were swimming around in his head like a large school of herring, and he
was once again succumbing to exhaustion. He looked at his wine glass. It was
empty. First order of business would be a refill, then he'd get Carol back in
the room so they could work through the business list. Just as he was about to
get up from his chair, the phone rang. It was Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, kid.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're not going
to believe this.&quot; Sanchez sounded excited, breathless even.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What? Tell me
he's there so I don't have to witness the horror of Eduardo's spending habits
any longer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not quite,&quot;
he replied, &quot;but his truck is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you <i>found</i>
this guy?&quot; She asked, the incredulity in her voice now trumping the
sorrow. There was fear there, too. Not for her. She knew he wouldn't hurt her,
even if she went to the police. Her fear was for him and the danger he was
facing. The look he had in the bar now made sense. Those steely blue eyes, how
they cut through everything in their path, were the focus of a man out for
revenge, a man out to settle a blood debt owed against his family. And it
wasn't just part of his family. It was all of it. Everything he'd ever really,
truly loved had been taken from him with violence, and he was out to collect on
that debt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes,&quot; he
replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You've thought
this whole thing through?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes.&quot; His
tone was matter-of-fact, sharpened a little by something. Impatience?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She knew it was a
stupid question. Of course he'd thought it out. He'd thought about nothing else
for more than two years. Thinking about it had dominated his every waking
moment, consumed him with an almost maniacal focus. She stood there for a
moment, not sure how to proceed. She'd help him. How could she not? He'd
probably saved her life. If Chuck had not killed her in the bar that evening,
then based upon what he'd said, he most definitely would've followed through
some other time. She shuddered at the thought, wrapped her arms around herself
as if she were standing in a meat locker, thankful she wasn't some bovine
carcass swinging on a cold hook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was something
else, too. She felt deeply for this man, knew he needed closure. If she
couldn't have him, and she wanted him, desperately, then she would most
definitely do whatever she could to help him along. Who was she to stand in his
way? Those people deserved it. <i>Kids</i>? A whorehouse full of <i>children</i>?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She continued to look
at him. He just stood there, waiting for some kind of response. For the first
time she saw him as Chuck might have. The look in his eyes alone could probably
kill some people. He was imposing. Powerful. Smart. Prepared. And he wasn't
afraid to kill for what he believed in. She knew she should walk away from it,
knew she should get as far away from him as she could. Killing was bad, right?
In this case, though, and even in Chuck's case, she knew in her heart it
wasn't. It was the right thing. Children. The fucking people were prostituting
little kids!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Her eyes once again
spilled over with tears. This time not out of sorrow and not out of fear. The
fear for him had abated suddenly; she was wrong for having felt it: whoever
these people were, she couldn't think of a single scenario in which they could
survive the onslaught wrought from the pent-up anger held by the man standing
in front of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll do whatever
you want,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He closed the distance
between them, took her in his arms, and held her. He whispered in her ear,
&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At that moment, she
felt like she was where she needed to be. Even if it was for only a few more
hours, she wanted to hold onto it. She could mourn his absence later, after he
was safely down the road, anonymous and in a distant place. Right now, though,
she simply wanted to enjoy him, enjoy his touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A persistent vibration
cut short the embrace. Clark retrieved his phone from his pocket, and answered
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He's willing to
meet you. We have to do it on his terms. He wants to meet after dark, a little
after nine this evening.&quot; The voice on the other end of the line sounded
tense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Perfect. Where
does he want to meet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Huntington Park.
There's a Shell station at the intersection of Florence and Avalon, 600
Block.&quot; He paused for a moment, then said, &quot;This is a bad idea,
Clark. In case you haven't checked lately, you're white, definitely not the
prevailing color in that part of town and definitely not safe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I understand, but
I have another color he and his friends might like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Green.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What do you need
him for?&quot; Joe asked, the tenseness in his voice now augmented with
bewilderment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know I can't
get you involved in this. Let's just keep your level of knowledge limited so
you don't get into any trouble. You have a family to worry about.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark could feel the
gears in Joe's mind working. He knew, though, that Joe understood, and there
really was nothing left to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Joe said, &quot;Ok.
It's your funeral, man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark slapped the phone
shut, then turned back toward Carri. The short conversation had brought him
back to reality, and he was once again thinking about what he needed to do ...
what <i>they</i> needed to do. He looked at his watch, said</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, we have
about four and a half hours. We have to go to the bank, it's open until six, so
we're going to have to hurry. Under the circumstances, I think we better take
your car.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark had worked out
the details of financing his mission a long time ago. After he sold his house,
he had about three hundred thousand dollars to deposit. He knew that simply
sticking the money into one account might cause problems someday if he went in
to withdraw it all. Problems big enough to warrant a phone call to the police.
So he'd decided to deposit just what he needed for day-to-day living in a
simple, non-interest bearing savings account. The rest he put into two safe
deposit boxes. He typically kept enough cash on his debit card to cover a month
of expenses, with a little more added for unforeseen, larger expenses. When his
savings account ran low, he'd simply visit the main bank, collect some money
from one of the boxes, and make a deposit. He'd lived like that for a little
more than two years. Today, he was going to take everything out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri drove to into the
parking lot of the main branch of American Federal Bank. She parked in a space
closest to the main entrance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said, &quot;Stay
here, and keep the car running. This is going to have to be quick.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stepped out of
the car and headed toward the entrance, empty brief case in hand. As he made
his way up the steps to one of the bank's large glass doors, he wondered how
much longer he was going to evade a BOLO. The police had found Eduardo; his
truck was there. If the apartment manager kept some kind of list for authorized
vehicles, he figured his time was growing short. He hurried into the lobby,
doing his best to tuck his head away from the army of cameras positioned around
the interior, recording every conceivable angle of each and every person who
walked onto the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He decided not to
bother with his savings account. He hadn't replenished it in almost a month, so
he figured there would be much less than a grand there. The added risk of
interfacing with one or two extra people outweighed the reward of another few
dollars, anyway. He'd just empty his boxes and be done with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He stopped and looked
around, located a man in a sharp blue suit with a thinnish red power tie who
looked like he could pass for management. Loan Officer. Clark told the man what
he needed. The man picked up a phone and a minute later a real bank manager was
standing in front of him, keys to his boxes jangling around his right
forefinger. Clark followed the manager to the rear of the bank and through a
wide, steel door. The manager, showed him his boxes, handed him his keys, then
abruptly turned and left, closing the steel door behind him. Ten minutes later,
Clark was back in Carri's vehicle, a little over two hundred thousand dollars
stuffed into his briefcase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You want to get
dinner?&quot; He joked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Based on what you
told me, I really doubt that's such a good idea,&quot; she scolded. &quot;Where
to?&quot; She asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark risked a glance
in her direction, knew it was probably the wrong thing to do. She was sitting
in the driver's seat, a simple cotton dress riding up her legs and exposing
about half of her lightly tanned  thighs. He worked his way up past a black
sash she wore to accentuate an already perfect waistline, past cleavage
revealed by a plunging neckline, to her face. She looked at him with dazzling
blue eyes, the dance in them had returned, if only lethargically. She had her
long, brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, part of which was draped over her
left shoulder. Her nose was a little large, but it stood out from her face
almost regally, separating her eyes from a perfect mouth that harbored perfect,
white teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can we eat at
your place?&quot; Clark asked, trying to rip his eyes from her but failing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sure.&quot; She
smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark ratcheted his
seat back, looked out the passenger window, and focused on what lay ahead. Joe,
of course, was right: he was definitely going to be out of his element in a few
hours, and if anything were to go wrong, he'd find himself in serious trouble.
Like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. That kind of wrong. He knew,
too, the trouble wouldn't come until after Joe left, when he was in the heart
of gangland, alone. He'd have to think of a way to keep them off-balance, get
what he was after, and get out while minimizing face time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You okay?&quot;
Carri asked, her pleasant voice and dancing eyes snapping him back to the
present, yanking him away from one set of possibilities and into another he
really didn't want to think about.  Her perfume drifted to him, filled his
olfactory with a pleasant, feminine aroma. Her essence pulled at him, as if she
were a powerful magnet and he some hapless lead filament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I'm fine.
Just thinking.&quot; In spite of himself, he continued to look at her. She was
smiling, happy. He hated that. He hated what had happened to his family. He
hated what he had to do. Most of all, he hated that he'd have to leave her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What the fuck do
you mean he didn't get her?&quot; Gerkowitcz practically spat as he slammed his
meaty fist onto his beautiful oak table, shaking an array of coffee cups and
saucers with the lipid blast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Neither Manheim nor
Malone said a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What the hell
happened? Are you sure this guy's cut out for this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim spoke up.
&quot;Dean, I assure you Rick's the best guy we have. In fact, he's responsible
for three of the remaining girls you have now. If he said the girl wasn't
there, then I'm inclined to believe him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz gave Manheim
a sideways look. The emaciated little man was squirming in his chair, fingers
laced in front of him, trembling with affliction. His greasy hair hung down to
the top of his collar, his glasses beginning to succumb to gravity, working
their way down the bridge of his nose. He wondered briefly if the guy was
trying to pull some power play, trying to squat on his authority in his absence
then try it on for size during his visits. Over the past several months, it
appeared Manheim had been nothing more than a worker bee, a desk jockey who had
no aspirations for leadership. Looking at him now, he saw some assertiveness,
but perhaps no more than the situation at hand warranted. He shook his head,
let out a barely audible chuckle. Even if Manheim were making some kind of
power play, what could he really do about it?  Without him, his operation would
be in the toilet. He decided to let it go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fine,&quot; he
growled. &quot;If she's a no-show again tomorrow, then we're changing products.
No sense in wasting time on depleted resources.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That would mean
another car, &quot; said Malone. &quot;Which'd delay us at least another
day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz  shook his
head again, this time more vigorously and with an audible growl. &quot;Look
guys, every day we have a spot open, we're losing revenue. We need to focus on
getting that God Damned room filled so we can get back up to capacity. So I
don't want to hear about any more fucking delays.&quot; He leaned into his
chair, the back creaking as he did. &quot;Maybe we should send another guy out
to a different region. What's the worst that could happen? We get two? Maybe
that'd be better for the girls anyway: we could add in a rotation. That might
keep them healthier longer. Bottom line guys: we need to kick up the revenue
stream or we're going to be in a little trouble. We've already over-extended
ourselves with that fucking security system.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Malone flinched, then
found his voice. &quot;Or maybe we can try a blitz at a busy park. Gets done
all the time. We roll up, scope it out, then snatch. We'd be gone before anyone
knew what happened.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim rapped his
knuckles on the table and shook his head back and forth vigorously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Stop. There are <i>reasons</i>
we operate the way we do, and both of you should know them by now. You did,
after all, help build our operational policies. We send one guy out in a stolen
car to minimize our risk. It's barely a blip on the radar. Our footprint on the
spyglass of law enforcement is <i>minimized</i>. You send a couple of guys out
there and all of a sudden that footprint is doubled, but the risk is more than
doubled. And that's because of plausible deniability. If one's caught, it's
your word against his. With the right lawyer, we can probably slip out of it.
If both are caught, though, you're done for. And a blitz? Frank, you should
know better. We have a good system. We steal cars that look just like the
parents' vehicles. Children don't notice that sort of thing. They see the car,
they get in, in spite of the voice that's calling them. Because of that,
potential witnesses aren't going to think anything of it. We've researched all
this for Christ's sake, remember?&quot; Manheim paused to let it sink in.
&quot;A snatch is going to sound off Amber alerts for sure. It's stupid. Let's
just give Rick some room to operate. He's the best we got. He's going to
deliver.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz just sat and
stared at Manheim, his perplexed look now replaced with one of respect and just
a little bit of fear for his own authority. Maybe the man wasn't a follower
after all. And maybe that wasn't such a bad thing. Maybe it was a <i>good</i>
thing. But still he had to make sure Manheim wasn't just blowing a bunch of hot
air just for the sake of making wind. He had to make sure there was conviction
there. He was fine with the guy growing his power a little. Nothing wrong with
giving latitude to a smart son of  bitch. But he couldn't allow hollow
authority. It had to be genuine. Deadly serious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You willing to
stake your life on that, Manheim?&quot; Said Gerkowitcz.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim paused for only
a moment. It was not, however, a delay brought about by panic. Gerkowitcz knew
better. Manheim was running through the probabilities, checking his figures,
and re-assessing his conclusion. After the moment passed, he looked at
Gerkowitcz and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Without a
doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he drove into the
desert, Rick started having second thoughts about killing Jason. The man was by
all accounts a major pain in the ass, and his actions definitely would get them
both killed or jailed if he were to continue to work with the moron. But he
wasn't sure if that warranted such a strong reaction. So he decided he'd try to
just scare the man, send him running in a direction away from him. If he scared
him badly enough, and Jason ran far enough, he'd never have to worry about
seeing him again. So he decided to try that first. Scare him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he started
talking, and Rick was immediately reminded of why he wanted to shoot the son of
bitch in the first place. After a series of conversational false starts, Rick
decided he'd give Jason three strikes. Three blatant acts of stupidity. Any
less, he'd simply send him on his way. If he filled his quota, then he'd kill
hm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first act of
stupidity was manifest in Jason's customary, incessant moronic jabbering, which
had alternated between a rambling, hollow diatribe about how the world was
getting too violent and a ridiculous assertion about his plan for climbing the
boss's organizational ladder, which, of course, ended with Jason running the
whole operation. Rick briefly wondered if the stupid fucker even recognized the
irreconcilable dichotomy that infected his thought processes. More likely, he
was just oblivious to his own ideas and how they were packaged and ejected from
the grotesque blow hole positioned at the lower front of his face.  Blow hole.
Even flipper had more important things to say than Jason. Strike one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>About 40 miles into the
desert, Rick found what he was looking for: a small, hilly region that obscured
a central bowl. He told Jason the women were waiting for them there. As they
climbed toward the lip, Jason had become visibly excited. It was clear he
actually believed that just a few hundred yards ahead an assortment of slutty
women were assembled, just waiting for some beer and his Johnson. Out in the
middle of nowhere. No other tire tracks apparent. No services in sight. Nothing
but an incomprehensibly hot landscape, plainly inhospitable to any living
creature save for snakes and scorpions. Apparently, Jason had watched too many
old music videos as a kid, had no idea people just did not, could not, get it
on in the middle of such an unforgiving wasteland. Rick figured there had to
have been some impactful trauma in the man's past, some terrible injury that
must've put the his mind in neutral. Sad, yes, but inconsequential for him.
Strike two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As they crested the
ridge, the view had obviously revealed to Jason a disappointing emptiness. The
excitement in him receded like the tide, pulling back with it all hope for his
shot at living out an unrealistic fantasy. Rick had reassured him, though, the women
would arrive shortly and they should take advantage of the time to dig a fire
pit with the shovels they'd brought along. Instead of questioning the
reasonableness of a bonfire in a scorching-hot desert, Jason's disposition had
immediately shot into orbit. Buoyed by a salvaged dream, the man pulled off his
shirt, grabbed a shovel, and commenced digging, jabbering on all the while
about how turned on the girls would be when they arrived to see him all
shirtless and sweaty. A man's man, ready to please. Strike three.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The ground in the
desert around San Bernardino is surprisingly shovel-friendly, so it had taken
little less than an hour for them to dig a hole six feet long, four feet wide,
and about three and a half feet deep. The rest was child's play. Given Jason's
capacity to understand simple cues, could it have been any different? Rick
launched himself out of the hole, declaring he was going to get them both a
cold one. He casually walked to the vehicle, slipped his gun into the small of
his back, and retrieved two beers. As he returned the pit, he threw one of the
beers to Jason and dropped the other. As Jason fielded his brew, Rick walked
off two more paces, leveled his gun, and fired. The sound of the shot was
caught by the height of the adjacent hills, reverberated between them, and then
finally died out altogether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick stood alone at the
edge of the pit. By the looks of Jason, he figured the bullet had probably
passed right above the bridge of his nose. The gaping hole in the back of the
man's head seemed to be right about at that level. He walked back to the van,
placed the gun on the floorboard just inside the door. He returned to his beer,
picked it up, and opened it. A burst of carbonated hops sprayed away from him.
He took one long draw, then picked up his shovel and buried the stupidest man
he'd ever met in his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The drive out of the
desert was slightly painful. The palms of Rick's hands were covered with
softened calluses and tiny blisters from the shoveling and the burying. They
stuck to the hot steering wheel. When he removed his hands or even turned a
corner, they hurt like hell. He cursed himself for not bringing gloves. Then he
thought about the silence, the abrogation of risk. Suddenly his hands felt a
lot better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he drove down the
215, he worked out his strategy for the next several hours: he thought briefly
about switching vehicles in the desert, but was sure a stolen vehicle abandoned
in the middle of nowhere might raise more suspicion than one simply left in the
parking lot of a busy mall. So he decided he'd return the van to the intended
location for the swap, get a cab back Jason's hotel, and pick up the Civic.
Then he'd drive back to Riverside, scope out the girl's place to ensure the
people were actually still in the house. Once he established the girl was still
a viable target, he'd return in the morning and pick her up on her way to
school.</p>
