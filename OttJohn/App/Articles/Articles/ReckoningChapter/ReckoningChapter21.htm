<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By the time Gerkowitcz
heard about the gate drop, it was too late. What the fuck was Frank thinking?
Of all the vehicles to come down <i>his</i> road, it had to be a fucking Crown
Victoria. Old people and cops. That's who drive those cars. And there wouldn't
be any old people wanting to drive off road to get to his spread in the middle
of the fucking desert, now would there? Out here, a Crown Vic <i>equals</i>
cops. Any fucking idiot should know to fall on the side of caution there. But
Frank didn't. So he engaged the release on the cattle guard, and the cops drove
right in. They could have pushed everyone into the shelter, left Manheim up top
to rake the fucking rock over the God Damned hatch, just like they had fucking
planned. Manheim would have been perfect. He's smarter than a hundred cops. He
could have played fucking stupid until the cops searched the place up and down,
got bored, and left. But it hadn't worked that way. How the hell was he
surrounded by so many stupid fucking people on a daily basis? <i>Fuck!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And the reassurances by
Frank hadn't helped, either. <i>They're alone. That means no warrant. That
means they don't have shit or they're here for another reason entirely. And
that means we can play this whole thing off like an accident, a glitch in the
security system</i>. Right. A wrecked cop car and a security system on a ranch
out in the middle of fucking nowhere. That's not going to raise any suspicions.
Fucking moron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But maybe they could
play it off. Maybe an apology and restitution would be good enough. But he
wasn't taking any chances, so he told Frank to arm himself, take his radio, and
start scouting the back side of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>About five minutes
after that all hell broke loose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The morning light had
begun to illuminate the property, so he had taken out his binoculars to scan
the road. He found the cop car immediately. The cottonwoods obscured a lot of
his view, but he could make out the important stuff and piece together in his
mind what he couldn't see. The cruiser's front end was deep in the pit; the
back end was sticking up, wheels off the ground. He saw Rick standing there,
between the van and the car. The cops were out. They were dressed in plain
clothes, had their hands up. It looked like Rick was pointing a handgun at the
guy nearest him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then Frank radioed,
said he'd spotted an intruder, about 300 yards to the east of the property.
Then the radio went dead. About ten seconds later, he heard the unmistakable
sound of a rifle shot, that crackling noise the air makes when a bullet moves
through it at supersonic speeds. Frank had shot and killed the guy, no
questions asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then Rick killed the
cop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then Rick got his
brains blown out by some other unknown intruder. The guy had just come up out
of the desert like a God damned phantom, leveled some kind of automatic at the
back of Rick's head, and then blew it off. And he wasn't a cop, either. Because
the very next thing he did was kill the other cop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Guns. He needed lots of
guns. He hadn't brought them up earlier because he thought there still might be
a chance to play nice with the officers. But now there were no officers. Just a
fucking maniac with an automatic. Gerkowitcz  dropped his binoculars and headed
for the shelter. That's where the guns were. They had lots of them, but besides
the rifle Frank took, they were all fucking pea-shooters, .22 calibers made up
to look deadly, like Chihuahuas done up with plastic fangs. He walked down the
steps into the basement, shuffled through the coarse gravel covering its floor,
then climbed down the hatch and into the Shelter. As he walked across the floor
of the great room, he found Manheim, gave him an update, and then told him to
lock the customers in the rooms with the girls. It wasn't for their protection.
He just didn't want a panic on his hands. That would make things more chaotic
than they already were, might make things completely unmanageable. So the less
they knew, the better. As Manheim walked away, Gerkowitcz hurried to the
armory, which was in the storage room, directly across from the boardroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He retrieved a large
set of keys from his right pants pocket, fumbled with them until he found the
one that opened the heavy metal cabinet used for weapons storage. He unlocked
it, turned a metal latch to open one of the doors, then reached in and grabbed
a scope-mounted rifle. As he lifted it out of the cabinet, he noticed his hands
were shaking. Four dead in barely a minute. What a fucking mess. He thought
briefly of his family, his daughter, mostly, and admitted to himself his fat,
lazy wife was infinitely more appealing than what he was facing now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He chuckled to himself,
then shook his head at no one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What was he supposed to
do? Lay down like a sniffling little pussy? No. He'd fight. Because that's who
he was: a fighter. A survivor. If Frank was right, no one knew where the
fucking cops were, anyway. They'd just clean the damn mess, kill the guy with
the automatic, then dump the whole lot of them, car and all, into one of the
water-laden pits out to the east. And to get all that done, he'd need Frank
back in the building. He found himself once again seething at the man's
stupidity, figured it would take a miracle to keep Frank out of the pit too
when all this was done. Gerkowitcz picked up his two-way radio, held it up to
his mouth, and keyed to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Frank, I need you
back here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You sure? I
haven't completely searched the area. There could be more.&quot; His voice was
labored and jumpy, as if he were running and out of breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Look, I'm not
really sure what the hell's going on, but I <i>do</i> know one thing: if we're
some kind of target here and there were more men out there, then we'd have been
inundated by now. But we haven't been. That just leaves the guy with the
automatic. And until we hear otherwise, we treat him as an unfriendly: shoot
first, ask questions later. And the last place he was seen was out front, so
that's where I need you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Roger that. On my
way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;And Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Double time it. I
need you here <i>now</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz stood next
to the open cabinet for a long moment, set his mind into motion. There had to
be an angle, something he could use to regain control quickly, put everything
back to the way it was. He thought about his resources, but they were mostly
defensive. Or non-functional. Like the fucking security system he'd hemorrhaged
money for over the past several weeks. The video system could've given him a
distinct advantage over the guy with the automatic, but of course it wasn't
hooked up yet. Then he thought about his customers. Maybe locking them up was
the wrong approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Manheim!&quot; He
almost screamed the name. The sound of his voice took him by surprise as it
boomed through the room and then echoed off its tall, concrete walls. It
sounded strong, authoritative. It made him feel better about things, made him
feel more in control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim rushed around
the corner, then stopped suddenly, eyes open wide in surprise, mouth agape at
seeing a rifle barrel pointing right at his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're not going
to shoot me, are you?&quot; His voice was halting, his words spoken slowly and
carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz regarded the
man. He was pale, thin, about as greasy as a mop dipped in peanut oil, and
about as weak as a doped-up anorexic. But he was smart, and he had the power of
persuasion. He lowered the rifle and smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How many
customers do we have right now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Full house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz shook his
head. These days, a full house meant <i>five</i> customers. Would've been six
if not for the stupid fucker who killed one of his girls earlier in the week.
Just another stupid person in a whole sea swimming with morons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You take a good
look at any of them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How many look
like they can handle a gun, operate under duress?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim cast his eyes
up at the ceiling, ruminated on the question for just a moment, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Four of them are
what I would consider to be less than ideal candidates for security
augmentation, if that's what you're getting at.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It is.&quot;
Jesus. He was working with fucking Radar O'Reilly. &quot;Go find the lamest
duck of the bunch, leave the guy you think's capable alone for now. We might
actually need him later.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What are we going
to do with a guy with no skills?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We're going to
send him out the front door and use him as bait. If we can flush this guy out,
maybe I can get a bead on him and blow <i>his</i> brains out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>For a few moments it
was almost quiet, the only sounds coming from the subdued rumble of the Vic's
V8 and the muted whine of the rear tires as they spun around in the air,
grabbing at nothing. It was a pleasant change from the cacophony of gunfire
that had just erupted, made him almost feel as if normalcy had descended into
the desert around him, promising everything was going to turn out all right.
But he knew that wasn't true. Not by a long shot. He sat on the ground, gun in
hand, doing his best to leverage the ambient calmness as way to focus his
vigilance. It appeared to be working until his short-lived peace was disrupted
by the sound of a man's voice, the voice of the man he'd been hunting for the
past couple of weeks. It was the voice of Jack Clark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Throw your weapon
out. Come out where I can see you. Do it slowly.&quot; The voice was calm, the
words spoken carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias remained where
he was, in a seated position, adjacent to the left front quarter panel of his
cruiser. He was alert, aware of everything around him, maybe even hyper-aware.
But like a patient who claims to see and hear everything when under the sleepy
spell of anesthesia, he was locked out of action, shackled by indecision,
overwhelmed by sensory input. He managed to glance to his right, around the
front of his car. He could see Sanchez lying on the ground no more than fifteen
feet away, face half blown off. The remaining eye, his left one, was looking
directly at him, unfocused, dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A whole bevy of
emotions welled up within him, the most prominent of which was anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias could feel it moving through
him, mixing with the adrenaline still coursing through his system. The
adrenaline focused the anger, removed its ambivalence, dissolved its impurities
until there was nothing left but rage. Suddenly, his indecision was gone,
vaporized by the toxicity of the raw emotion burning within him. He wanted to
do something. He wanted to come out firing. But he knew he couldn't. Not
because he was scared. He was beyond that. And not because he was at a tactical
disadvantage, either. He'd been in this situation before, knew how to handle
it. He couldn't come out firing because there was nobody left to shoot, nobody
to bear the brunt of his rage. He wasn't going to kill Clark. That's because
Clark hadn't tried to kill <i>him</i>. He could have, but he chose to fire off
a burst into his car instead. And that was his last shackle, the only remaining
circumstance that was holding him back. And it wasn't coming off. At least not
yet. So he just sat where he was, trying to push his mind into a lucid
contemplation about what to do next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's your
name?&quot; The voice was still calm, almost peaceful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tobias.&quot; He
could hear himself answer the question, but it felt as if someone else had
offered up the response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know who you
are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then you know why
I'm here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then you know I
have no quarrel with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Look, I have no
intention of harming you. I just want to talk. Please toss your weapon toward
the front of your vehicle and come out so I can see you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias shifted in the
dirt until his back was pressed firmly against the cruiser. Clark sounded
sincere, but he couldn't take that risk, couldn't just give up his gun and walk
right into a situation that had a high probability of being an ambush. It wasn't
that he didn't believe Clark. He was inclined to. But a guy doesn't throw away
years of training and a mountain of stats that overwhelmingly indicate that if
you give up your firearm to an opponent, more times than not you're going to
wind up dead. Better to err on the side of caution, give the nod to the
worst-case scenario. So he maintained his position, decided his best route was
to build up a conversation, engineer a dialog that might knock down Clark's
defenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can't do it,
Clark. Department policy. And besides, I don't have any practical reassurance
you aren't going to just blow my head off once you see me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But you do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How's that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I shot your
radio, Tobias. If had wanted to kill you, we wouldn't be having this
conversation. You'd be dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias didn't reply,
just sat motionless, thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Look, you need to
understand something: I made a promise to my little girl. At her grave. I'm
going to keep it, Tobias. Please don't make me do something I really don't want
to do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias shifted his
position, kept his gun close to his side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, I
understand that. I even sympathize with it. But it's not going to bring them
back, Clark. All you're doing is adding to a body count already way too high.
Think about it. What will this bring? What good can come of this? You have them
now. You have them cornered. You know where they are. Let the legal system take
over. We can forget about everything that's happened, and you can just go
home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Home? What home?
Everything that was home, everything that was the best part of me, was taken
two years ago. I made a promise. I'm going to keep it. And you're right: I've
got them, and now they're going to pay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're making a
mistake, son. Let me call for backup. I can get a hundred cops out here in no
time. No one else has to die.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I've already
given the system a chance. It failed. Now it's my turn. I don't want your help;
I don't need your help.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then what do you
want from me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just to turn your
head for a little bit. That's all I ask. If you can do that, if you can give me
a few hours, I'll come back and turn myself in. You have my word on that.&quot;
Clark hesitated, then continued. &quot;But if you can't, Tobias, if you're
going to try to stand in my way ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias cut him off.
&quot;Yeah, I know. I'm a dead man. Doesn't look like I have much of a choice
now, do I? Automatic versus a department-issue pea shooter? Story of my life.
But you have to know I can't make promises like that, Clark. I've sworn to
uphold the law, not facilitate its decimation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias thought about
what he'd said, concluded it sounded hollow in the face of what had just
happened. Sanchez was dead. He'd lost more than a partner. He'd lost a good
friend. A son. And he felt responsible. But there was something else: the rage
he'd felt earlier was being polluted by confusion and uncertainty, the deadly
focus it had given him was eroding, giving way to a fundamental question posed
by overwhelming circumstance: why the hell shouldn't Clark head down the road
and shoot up the place? Every son of a bitch in there deserved a bullet in the
head as far as he was concerned. Every last one. But he knew that wouldn't
bring Sanchez back. Nothing would bring the kid back. He was a corpse now. And
that's all he'd ever be until the end of time. Why? No reason. Because he was
there. The son of a bitch killed Sanchez because he was there. He asked himself
the question again. <i>Why not</i>? He couldn't think of any good reason. None.
So he'd just turn his head. Let Clark do his thing. Then clean up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias emptied the
chamber of his handgun, ejected the cartridge, then threw it toward the front
of his cruiser. It landed toward the left side of the road, about ten feet in
front of the gaping hole left by the phony cattle guard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark ... I'm
coming out. I'm unarmed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He waited for a reply
but got none. He slowly turned until he was facing his cruiser, then began
lifting himself upward, at a glacial pace, just until  his eyes could see over
and around the crumpled hood of his wrecked vehicle. He saw nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Clark?&quot; His
voice was barely above a whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>No response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm going to do
what you want. I'm okay with it. I'll look the other way. I'm coming out now,
okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>No response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Are you going to
answer?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>No response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was already partially
exposed. He knew Clark could be anywhere, have him sighted in, head right in
the crosshairs of his scope, ready for the kill shot. But he knew that wasn't
the case. If Clark had wanted to kill him, he'd have been dead already. Simple
as that. He didn't know why Clark wasn't answering, but he was certain he was
going to find out in the next few seconds. Maybe it was some kind of
psychological ploy, a dominance thing. He took a deep breath, then exhaled
slowly as he stood. As his head cleared the cruiser just enough to give him an
unimpeded view of the area directly in front of him, he discovered why Clark
wasn't talking to him. He'd already left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The shot he'd heard,
the one that set off the deadly exchange on the road, wasn't from one of the
Mossbergs. Nor was it from any kind of handgun, either. It was the distinctive
crack of a high caliber rifle, which had most likely fired a long range shot
that ended Tiny's life. He had to be dead. There was no other conclusion. No
three clicks. Tiny wasn't distressed. Tiny wasn't anything. Not anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he crawled along the
tree line, Clark made a mental checklist of what he had. It wasn't that he
didn't already know. It was more about keeping his mind busy, maintaining his
mental acuity as he slid along the desert floor like a snake dressed up in
cotton outerwear. He focused on the small of his back, could feel the presence
of the Steyr strapped there, secured firmly to his mid-section by several
orbits of duct tape. The handgun had one round in the chamber and another
sixteen in the clip. It was unused and ready for action. He spent four of the
Vinny's bullets: one into the back of some guy's head, then another three
rounds into the cruiser. That left six rounds in the clip with another ten in
his pockets. Should be enough. Unless the place had a sizeable security team.
But he seriously doubted that. If they had, they would've pressed and flushed.
But they didn't, which meant there'd be no more than five guys in his way, probably
four or less. Plus some customers and kids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He fell into a pattern
as he made his way toward the buildings in front of him: he'd crawl on his
belly for ten feet, stop for two minutes, then repeat. When he stopped, he'd
lay motionless, then silently scan his immediate area for threats. It was an
exercise requiring stamina and patience, two things he was beginning to run
short of. He figured it was a pretty good system, though: it had allowed him to
progress more than a hundred yards without getting fired at or shot. He'd been
assessing his surroundings during one of his stops when he heard a sound. It
was a cracking noise, like a twig makes when fractured by the weight of a
heavy, moving object. The crack was followed immediately by the clumsy thumping
of footfalls, dampened by the desert sand. It came from his left, on the other
side of the road, emanating from a location just about perpendicular to where
he was dug in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He pushed his face into
the dirt, waited for several seconds, then looked up and scanned the area
around him. Save for his rear, he could see no obvious threats. He rolled up
into a sitting position, placed his back against the trunk of a large
cottonwood, then slowly raised the barrel of the Vinny, used it as a pointer to
scan the other side of the road. He had to shift the barrel a full twenty five
degrees to his left before he saw the figure of a man moving quickly toward the
vehicles. He peered through the scope, placing the crosshairs on the back of
the man's bobbing head.  He had a handgun in his right hand, pointing in no
particular direction. He was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved cotton shirt. And
he was thin. As he walked, he shifted his head from side to side, almost
frantically, looking for threats. When he turned his head to the left, Clark
could see he was old. He had wrinkles, a stubbly grey beard, and a long,
bulbous nose that seemed to burst out of an otherwise flat face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Thin, old, and scared.
Definitely not the guy who ran the place. Not security, either. A disappearing
cattle guard and an employee who almost took down two cops single-handedly told
him the person who ran the operation spared little expense for security and
qualified personnel. The man he was looking at didn't fit the profile. He
looked like he wanted to get away, not defend. He lowered the Vinny, concluded
the guy was a customer, probably conscripted into service under a
this-is-the-only-way-you're-going-to-save-your-ass argument. Instead of trying
to help the cause, the guy looked as though he took the gun and decided to make
a run for it, take his chances with the heat and the dryness of the desert.
Good decision for an old guy. Too bad for him a pissed off cop was just down
the road, waiting to take his anger out on somebody. So Clark let him go. No sense
in giving up his location for that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He continued to move on
his belly like a slug, undulating along the ground, becoming one with it. He
worked his way along the side of the road, using the cottonwoods, an occasional
shrub, and dirt as camouflage. He felt as though he'd been crawling for hours,
but the position of the sun told him otherwise: it was high in the sky, just
short of its zenith. He'd been crawling for perhaps just under an hour, give or
take a few minutes. He was sweaty. He was hot. He was running out of water. But
with each crawl forward, he could see the buildings in front of him loom
larger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There were two main
structures: one looked more like a typical residence, sporting a small yard and
curtained windows. A half-consumed beer balanced precariously on the railing of
its modest front porch. The other building, on the other hand, displayed none
of the accoutrements of family quarters. It was much larger and much older than
the smaller structure. It had a large front door and an even larger window that
gave an unimpeded view of a gravel clearing in front of it. The gravel had a
multitude of depressions leading to cement steps, indentations most likely made
by frequent foot traffic. He concluded the older house was more than likely the
center for business activity, so he decided to split his attention between the
structures so he'd be watching the main building eighty percent of the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He got comfortable, dug
himself in for a long wait. But almost immediately, something happened. Something
he'd been looking for. He saw two people at the large window: one rail thin
with greasy hair, the other fat and older. The fat guy appeared to barking at
the thin man. Clark figured him for the boss, or at least some kind of
supervisor. That made the smaller guy expendable. Clark rolled over onto his
back, lifted his head, and checked his rear. Nobody behind him. Nothing to his
sides, either. He returned his attention to the window, placed the crosshairs
of his scope on the little man, centering them directly on his forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he did a quick
calculation regarding his next move, the one following the one he'd already
queued up, the one that would end the life of the thin man. He thought about it
for  several moments, concluded it was risky but acceptable. Besides, it was
the only thing he could think of doing, the only course of action he could take
if he were to push his little war to a quick conclusion. The little man
maintained his position, appeared to absorb the tongue lashing from the fat man
the way a paper towel might absorb a rancid, liquid mess. Clark kept the
crosshairs on the man's forehead and used his left thumb to move the shot
selector on the Vinny to single. He took a deep breath, then exhaled to empty
his lungs. Then he squeezed the trigger and fired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He figured it was a
reasonable plan. Their decoy, some old guy named Charlie, had been tasked with
a simple objective: just walk the road. Then he'd wait, hidden behind the
couch, rifle barrel leveled over its back. He'd follow Charlie through his
scope and look for an opportunity. He hoped Charlie would spook the guy with
the automatic, cause him to take a shot. And that's all he needed. If Charlie
drew fire, he could get a bead on the guy and take him out from the safety of
the house, lay down a series of well-placed shots, right through the front
window. But it didn't work out that way. Charlie did what he'd asked him to do,
but he just kept on walking. Nothing happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The mistake had been in
standing. The guy hadn't been flushed out, so he just wasn't out there, right?
It was a reasonable conclusion. So they stood. Right in front of the fucking
window. He'd been in the middle of giving Manheim an earful about his
uncustomary lack of invention, the untimely logjam of genius he needed from him
badly to solve the crisis unfolding around them. Manheim had just been standing
there listening, giving him his full attention, both eyes focused, absorbing
everything in that sick fucking intellectual way that made Gerkowitcz want to
rip his head off and piss down his throat. Then his face exploded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Besides the sound of
the window shattering, the only thing he'd heard was a muffled pop, like when
fireworks are going off in the distance. But this wasn't a shot taken from a
distance. It was close. Through the corner of his left eye, he saw it: a faint
flash, from low on the ground, less than fifty yards away. The next few seconds
were a blur. He'd dropped to the floor, then crawled on his hands and knees to
the back of the room to take cover behind an antique desk. It was made of
thick, polished wood, solid craftsmanship, the kind he hoped would stop
whatever fucking bullets the guy outside was spitting out of that God damned
automatic. A fucking <i>silenced</i> automatic at that. Who the fuck was this
guy? Whoever it was, he'd definitely established one thing for sure: he wasn't
just after the cops; he was after him too. He was attacking his business. The
cops just happened to be in the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He waited behind the
desk for another shot, a frontal assault. He half expected the guy to come
charging through the front door, lay down devastating bursts of automatic fire,
riddle the entire building with bullet holes. But the assault didn't come.
After about five minutes, he made a tentative grab for his rifle, laid the
muzzle over the surface of the desk. Then he slowly raised up, giving himself
just enough room to peer out of the shattered window. Nothing. He inched up
further, just enough so his left eye was even with the scope on the rifle. He
looked through it, dead ahead. Nothing. He inched up a little more, just enough
to allow him to swing the rifle to the left and right while looking through the
scope. Nothing. The fucker just disappeared. Right back into the fucking
desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He continued scanning
the property for another ten minutes, finally concluded it was safe to move
about. So he crawled on his hands and knees to where he'd been standing when
Manheim had been blown away, right to the spot where he'd dropped his radio. He
picked it up, then keyed to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Frank! Where the
fuck are you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The radio crackled,
then Frank's voice came back. It was clear, as if he were standing right in the
next room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Approaching the
back of the house. Be with you in less than five.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Keep your fucking
eyes peeled! Manheim's dead. That fucker dropped him right through the front
window. I certain it's just the one guy, the same one who killed Rick. He's
either still out front pressed into the dirt, or he's pulled back and may be
heading in your direction, so watch yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Want me to check
it out?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz dropped his
head for a moment, briefly wondered how low Frank's IQ was. The guy had just
killed three men. Systematically. Like he did it for a living. He had a fucking
silenced automatic. And he was moving about like he was a part of the desert.
Like he <i>was</i> the desert. Frank was good, but he wasn't <i>that</i> good.
Not against someone like that. And he didn't have the fucking sense to know it.
Part of him wanted to tell him to go ahead and search the area. Just to rid
himself of the moron. But he knew if Frank got wasted, his chances for survival
diminished to just about nil. He needed Frank, if just for a little longer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Negative. Just
get your ass back here. We need to talk about this, then do something.
Fast.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Roger that. Just
about there. Sit tight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz put the
radio down, then glanced to where Manheim had been standing. He was sprawled on
the floor. He had a hole the size of a silver dollar in the back of his head.
An effusion of blood and brain matter had poured through it, soaking the floor around
him in a crimson pool about three feet in diameter. He felt his stomach heave
just a little. He turned away, crawled back behind the desk, then sat and
waited for Frank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Frank arrived less than
two minutes later. Gerkowitcz spent the following five minutes detailing what
they'd done and how Manheim had died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Frank said,
&quot;Sounds like a good strategy, but after what you've told me about this
guy, a passive attack is definitely not going to work. There's something else,
too. Something I was thinking about on the way back in. He's not a cop, so who
is he?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How the fuck
should I know, Frank? I'm on the business side of this operation, remember? My
job's to make this run, not to understand who could be behind potential threats
to it! That's your God damned job!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Right.&quot;
Frank paused, sucked in his breath. &quot;I think there's really only one
plausible conclusion, Dean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You want to tell
me what you're thinking, Frank? We're wasting time here while that asshole is
out there planning his next move.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He's a parent of
one of the girls, Dean. And somehow, he's found us. The police caught on to
what he was doing, and that's why they were here too. It's the only thing that
makes sense.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz nodded his
head in agreement. A fucking parent. Not a maniac. A highly-skilled and very
pissed parent. Then he had an idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then let's march
all the girls out front, line them up, and threaten to kill them one-by-one
until he surrenders. We can take up position inside the house on either side of
the window and just wait. If his kid's in here, can you think of any better
leverage?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Frank hesitated for a
moment. &quot;Not gonna work, Dean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Because it keeps
us locked into a single position at the front of the house. He'll see that and
attack from the rear. He's got the advantage there. If one of us leaves to
watch the back of the house, he'll know that too, and he'll still attack from
the rear. Except now, we've been split up, and that would be exactly what he
wants. So again he'll have the advantage. In any event, staying in the house is
a bad idea. If he gets in, there's too much cover for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So what do you
propose we do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The guy you had
in mind to help out, he any good?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, we need to
find out. Another gun would definitely shift the odds into our favor.
Overwhelmingly. Because what we're going to have to do, Dean, is press him. We
need to be outside, in a three-man front, sweep the area in a circular fashion
around the house until we find him. Once we do, it's three against one. He
won't stand a chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What if he gets
into the house?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He won't. We'll
be spaced apart sufficiently early in the sweep so that can't happen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz rubbed his
hands over his face and thought. He liked the idea, but he'd already seen four
people get blown away, and he didn't particularly like the idea of being the
fifth. For the first time since this bullshit started, we was beginning to
wonder if he was going to come out of this alive and intact. He lowered his
hands, gripped his rifle, then looked at Frank dead in the eyes. He wanted to
gauge his response, wanted to ascertain his confidence level with enough
precision to leave no doubt about his answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What if the guy's
just too good, Frank?&quot; He said it in a low voice, carefully, enunciating each
syllable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nobody's <i>that</i>
good.&quot; Frank shifted his gaze for a moment, then shifted it back to meet
Gerkowitcz's stare. &quot;I'm not going to lie to you, Dean: odds are, one of
us will go down if we're not extremely careful. We need to find him <i>before</i>
he finds us. And that's going to be a tall order. Because if he's still out
there, then he's waiting and watching. But I really doubt he's doing that right
now. I'm betting you're right and he's doubled back. He's going to come around
and approach from the rear. And if he's going to do that without getting his
head blown off, then he's going to give this place a wide berth, probably come
around the way his buddy did. That means we've got just as good a chance
spotting him first as he does us. But look at this way: even if he does get off
the first shot, it'll be his last. Trust me. We're going to come out of this
okay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz kept his
mouth shut. After what had happened, just the sight of Frank made him sick.
Trust him? Right. But he also knew Frank was his best hope of getting through
this mess alive. Hell, if Frank got him through this, he might even let him
live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay,&quot; he
said, &quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Let's get
downstairs, make sure this guy's gonna play. Given the circumstances, I really
don't see how he can refuse. Once we get him onboard, we'll come back upstairs
and plan out what we need to do and how we're gonna do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz didn't want
to plan. He wanted action. He wanted this whole mess to be over with. Now. He
didn't see how planning was going to help much. But he also knew he was out of
his element, really didn't know what the next best step should be, which made
him feel helpless. And he hated that. He also knew offering up any kind of
argument at this stage in the game introduced a costly delay to the response he
wanted. Whether they survived could hinge on how quickly they got their asses
in gear and pushed the assault onto the intruder. It was three against one, and
that wasn't bad. Put his odds of survival right at two-thirds, all things being
equal. But not all things were equal. He'd be careful, he'd keep his head down,
and he'd survive. So instead of arguing about any costly delays in action, he
shut his mouth and followed Frank into the basement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias scanned the
desert in front of him, then looked up and down the tree line bordering the
access road, looking for Clark. They'd been talking only a few minutes before,
but somehow the guy had managed to completely disappear, dissolve into the
desert. After a few more unproductive minutes, he gave up, decided his time
would be better spent re-arming himself. He was still on the driver's side of
his cruiser. He'd tossed the handgun to that side, just in front of a large
tree that bordered the road. It was almost a perfect throw. Just in case things
with Clark had turned ugly, his vehicle and the trees behind him would have
provided sufficient, if not intermittent, cover for its retrieval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He collected his gun
and clip, purposefully keeping his eyes to his left as he did. He chambered a
round, then retrieved his cell phone from his pocket. No signal. As he walked
back to the front of his cruiser, he kept his eyes fixed to the right. Then he
stared at the car. The entire front end of the vehicle had lurched into the
pit; the hood was completely crushed; and the windshield was shattered. There
was a sweet smell in the air that told him the car was leaking radiator fluid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He stared at the ground
for a long moment, chastising himself for two cowardly omissions: when he
retrieved his gun, he should've looked to his right; when he walked back to the
car, he should've looked to his left. But he didn't. Sanchez was there. And he
wasn't ready for that. Not yet. He had to cap his emotions before he could
shift his attention. Anger and sorrow. They were like twin Cobras, sometimes
lashing out individually, sometimes together, both filling his head with their
deadly venom. But he had to see to the kid. He deserved it. So he pushed the
snakes to the side, willed himself around the car, focusing on every single
step. And then he was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He stood next to his
body for what seemed like an eternity, then knelt down. He extended a hand, ran
his fingers through the kid's hair, then recoiled at its dampness. He looked at
his fingers, a sticky residue painted them up here and there in red. He held
his hand in front of his face, considered it briefly, but mostly looked right
through it, seeing nothing at all. He felt the emotions that had been rushing
through him earlier drain away, replaced now with a sickening numbness he'd
never experienced before. He looked again at his partner, extended his hand
once more, this time to his face to close the lid on his remaining eye. Then he
backed off just a little. But he couldn't tear his gaze away from the body. It
had two faces. One was at peace,. The other, the side that was destroyed,
looked violently broken, violated. He couldn't let his partner be found like
that, exposed to the world. He needed a sheet, a blanket. Something to cover
the him up. Something to protect his dignity when the techs and the first of an
army of officers arrived from more jurisdictions than he could count.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He had a blanket in the
cruiser, but it was in the trunk, and the trunk was in the air at a height that
would make retrieving it almost impossible. So he decided to check the van. As
he passed the body of the man who'd killed Sanchez, he noticed his handgun. It
had been kicked away, was half-buried in the gravel road about ten feet from
where he lay. He stopped to pick it up, chambered a round, clicked on the
safety, then tucked the gun into his beltline. As he approached the side door
of the van, he heard the sound of footsteps to his right. They were falling at
a cadence that suggested a hurried walk. He took three quick steps to the rear
of the vehicle, then crouched down and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As the man walked along
the driver's side, he moved behind the right rear wheel, then watched. About a
second later, old man emerged in front of him. He was walking fast, holding a
gun in his right hand, tripping his way down the side of the road. He waited
until the guy was about ten feet from him, then drew his weapon and ordered him
to stop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Drop your
gun!&quot; He said it quietly, just loud enough for the man to hear him, but
quiet enough not to give his position away to anyone else who might be nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man stopped. He
didn't release his weapon, but Tobias could tell he was visibly shaken. He
re-iterated his command, this time adding the requisite authority for the request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Police officer.
Drop your weapon, get down on your knees, and clasp your hands behind the back
of your head. Do it now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man complied.
Tobias held onto his gun with his left hand, retrieved his cuffs with his
right. He walked up behind him, took his hands one-by-one, moved them down to
the small of his back, and cuffed him. Then he said something that was simply a
result of years of training, something that didn't make sense given the
circumstances. But he couldn't help himself. Some things just happen
automatically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cuffs too
tight?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. They're
fine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias grabbed the
cuffs, then yanked on them lightly until the man slowly raised himself to his
feet. Then he turned him around so they were facing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Who are you, and
what are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man shrugged, gave
him a casual look that masked the stress he was undoubtedly feeling. &quot;Just
a guy out for a nature walk, officer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't lie to me,
asshole. I know what's going on here. And so do a lot of other people. In fact,
in about ten minutes, there's going to be an army of cops crawling around here,
shooting first and taking names later. So it'd be in your best interest to
cooperate and answer the damn question. If you don't, I'll just turn you loose
and let them find you. Then you can see how far you get answering questions
with a bullet in your head. Now, what's your name?&quot; There was a
condescending tone to Tobias's voice, an edge that got the man's full
attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Charlie.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, Charlie,
what are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm a customer,&quot;
he stuttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias pointed at the
gravel road behind the man. &quot;With a gun?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. They sent
me out here to flush out some guy their scared of, said he'd already killed one
of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you just took
the gun and marched right on down the road, no fear you might be killed by the
guy they're after?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, man, they
said they'd kill me if I didn't do it. It's not like I had a choice.&quot; He
said it as if he'd experienced a whole lifetime of having to do things he
didn't want to, as if he were a victim of actions he'd taken at the behest of
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took a step
back, considered what Charlie said at face value, in spite of the plastic
delivery. He was old and thin. His approach was sloppy. He'd given up too
easily. Not security. So he was probably telling the truth. But what to do with
him? He couldn't put him in the car. He couldn't leave him outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But he could put him in
the van.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias grabbed
Charlie's cuffs, started leading him toward the side door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where're you
taking me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm going to lock
you in the van so I don't have to worry about your sleazy old ass.&quot; He
half-heartedly reprimanded himself for his response, but then realized he
didn't really care about prisoner protocol at that moment. He was way beyond
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As they walked, Tobias
holstered his weapon, felt he didn't need it. Not with Charlie, anyway. When
they got to the side door, Tobias stopped the old man, moved him to his left,
then checked the handle on the door. It was unlocked. He pulled the it all the
way out, releasing the latch, then slid it open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he found himself
looking at something he should've expected but was altogether unprepared for. A
girl. On a mattress. Dead. That was clear. She'd asphyxiated on her own vomit.
It had clogged all of her airways, pushed its way out of her mouth, and
dribbled down the sides of her face. Another victim. A potential sex slave that
had succumbed on the ride out. He shifted his gaze over the body, figured her
to be  no more than eight years old, probably in the third grade. She most
likely played with dolls, most likely had an unquestioning trust in adults. As
with most children her age, she was missing a vigilance she shouldn't have been
required to possess in the first place: she lacked a fundamental cynicism that
resulted in her death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He felt his face flush,
felt pure rage once again course through his veins. He tried to calm himself by
taking several deep breaths, but it didn't work. He could feel his heart
thumping, beating against his ribcage like a basketball bouncing against a
hardwood floor. The girl didn't have to die. Just as Sanchez didn't. But they
both did. Why? Because of the sleaze-bag who was standing next to him. So his
perverted sexual needs could met for a profit. That's why they died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He felt himself turn to
face Charlie. Somewhere deep in his mind, he knew the man wasn't the direct
cause of the death that lay around him. But he was certainly a major factor. He
felt his right hand ball up into a fist. Then he felt his shoulder lurch and
his hand swing around to deliver a haymaker blow that landed flush against the
diminutive man's face. The old man stumbled, fell to the ground, then coughed
and spit out blood and a single tooth. His breathing was labored for about a
minute, then he got it under control, looked up at Tobias and smiled. It was
full of defiance, full of malice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Bad move,
officer. Now I got you on police brutality. Only thing a jury's gonna believe
now is you're trying to railroad me. I'm just an old man. A guy who got beat up
by an over-aggressive cop. They're gonna have sympathy for me. They're gonna
let me go. And you know what? I just lost a tooth and a little blood for it.
You? You're gonna lose your job.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Suddenly, Tobias felt
the world slow down. His heart rate seemed to return to normal. The rage was
still there, but it felt comfortable, like a favorite garment. He looked at the
old man. He was still talking, but he sounded far off, delivering his words in
slow motion. Tobias wanted to tell him something, but his mouth wasn't
cooperating, was moving too slowly for his thoughts. After what seemed like
ages, he heard the words come out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know what old
man?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Charlie's smile got
wider, dripped with arrogance.&quot;No. But tell me. I'm just <i>dying</i> to
know what you're gonna say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias returned the
smile. &quot;Yes. Yes, you are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Between a thought and a
corresponding action lies a layer of will, the thickness of which is governed
by an uneasy alliance between rational thinking and un-tethered emotion. Tobias
was beyond reason. All he could see was red. All he could feel was hate. All he
wanted was revenge. His layer of will had diminished to a point that it only
took a twitch, an inclination of an action he was thinking, to make it happen.
It started with a subtle motion of his right hand, reaching toward his
beltline. Toward the gun. It ended with a bullet in Charlie's head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Charlie's body lay
crumpled on the ground at his feet, a single, red dot marking the center of his
forehead. He didn't know why he did it. But he didn't feel bad about it,
either. Just like Sanchez had said, they weren't even human. They didn't even
deserve to breath the same air. He knelt beside the man, grabbed his shirt, and
tore off a piece. He wiped the handle and the trigger guard of the gun with it,
walked it over to the guy who'd killed Sanchez,  knelt down, and wrapped the
dead man's hands around the handle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Then he stopped,
suddenly aware he'd discharged a weapon, made a very loud noise that would most
likely attract attention. He quickly made his way behind the van for cover,
took out his handgun, and waited for the reaction. But it never came. No
commotion. No shots. Nothing. He figured that could mean one of two things:
either Clark had finished his business, one way or the other, or nobody had heard
the shot. Or no one was interested. He got up, slowly walked around to the side
of the vehicle, arms outstretched in front of him, gun leading the way. But
there was nobody around. And no one was coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He lowered his weapon,
looked into the open side door of the van. There was a blanket there. It was
folded up and placed right next to the dead girl. He removed it, walked over to
Sanchez, and used it to cover his body. He looked at his cell phone one more
time. Still no signal, so he threw it into the passenger side of the cruiser.
He looked toward the buildings in the distance, toward where all the action
lay. It was his new destination. It was the place he had to go. It was where
the kids were. And he had to do what he could to save them. That and make the
bastards pay. And there was only one way to get there, too. The same way Clark
was probably moving about. He had to take the tree line. He had to press
himself into the ground. He had to get dirty and crawl on his belly. So he
walked to the nearest cottonwood, then dropped to the earth. He pushed his body
into the dirt, bathed himself in it until he could taste it, until he smelled
like the desert. Then he started crawling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd wanted to take two
shots: one to eliminate the thin guy with the greasy hair, the other to keep
the fat guy, the one he'd hoped was the boss, on the floor. That's how he
figured he'd escape. No eyes looking his way, so he'd have the luxury of
sprinting across an open field, back to his truck to resupply. But the Vinny
had jammed. No second shot. He'd continued looking through the scope, saw
nothing through the shattered window. He knew the big guy would hit the floor.
The second shot would have been a little persuasion to keep him there longer.
But with no second bullet, he knew he'd have to move fast, so as soon as he saw
the window was clear, he turned and sprinted. Twenty minutes later, he was at
his truck, thirsty, hot, exhausted, clothes caked with desert mud from all of
the sweat that had poured out of his body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He liked the Vinny,
thought it was slick. But he didn't have time to repair it. So he opened his
truck, removed the second Mossberg from under the bench seat in the rear, and
leaned it against the passenger-side seat, butt-end rising from the floor. Then
he jumped into the driver's seat, retrieved his canteen and the spare, and
filled both with water from one of the plastic jugs he'd picked up at the store
earlier that morning. He drank the water conservatively, taking frequent, small
sips to ensure it was absorbed by his body and not just dumped into his
stomach. He didn't want it sloshing around when he had to start moving again.
In between sips, he poured some of the water on his head and neck. It quickly
evaporated, taking away much of his excess body heat with it, leaving him
feeling refreshed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As he felt his strength
return, he thought about how he'd work the final step in his assault on the
facility. He'd killed two employees, so he figured there'd probably be one to
three others he'd have to deal with. Best case was just the one guy left, the
boss. But he wasn't into best case scenarios. He'd learned in the military that
there were no sunny days in battle, that a healthy pessimism provided a good
umbrella to protect against the rain of enemy fire. So he decided to continue
with the expectation that there'd be three guys in front of him, all of them
armed, all of them healthy, all of them wanting nothing more than to see his
body full of their lead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So what to do in that
case? Drive in. Not around front. Through the field around the back. The way
Tiny had gone. If he ran into them along the way,  the truck would provide
adequate protection, give him something to place between himself and the
bullets they'd be firing at him. If he got in far enough without being seen,
the truck would provide a decent base for retreat in case things got too hot.
It seemed like the best thing to do. And he figured he could probably get to
within a quarter mile of the facility without alerting them to his presence by
the sound of the truck's big diesel engine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He checked the Mossberg
to ensure it was loaded and ready to fire, then reached into the back seat to
retrieve the bags of ammunition Tiny had placed there earlier. He opened the center
console, pulled out the spare Steyr, and placed it on the passenger-side seat.
He tucked the other one beneath his right thigh, handle facing in so he could
grab it quickly. Save for the bullets for the rifle, he dumped the remaining
ammunition into the center console for easy access in case he needed to reload
in a hurry. To ensure the lid didn't slam shut while he was driving, he gripped
the top of it and twisted until it tore loose from its hinges. Then he fired up
his truck, backed out onto the road, cranked his wheels hard to the right, and
drove out into the open, hilly terrain that bordered the eastern part of the
facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was slow going, and
it was rough for the big truck. After about an hour of creeping along the
uneven desert terrain, Clark found he could go no further. He'd looped around
the east side of every hill he ran into, only turning west when he felt his
position was approximately in line with the buildings on the property. He made
it a few hundred yards further, parking his truck on the east side of yet
another of the region's small hills. As he scrutinized the ground that lifted
away from him, he found it provided no resources for cover, save for a couple
of low-lying shrubs and an outcropping of rock that might save his ass in a
pinch. If he were to find himself confronted with an all-out frontal assault,
he figured his best bet would be a non-linear dash to his truck, behind which
he'd find some protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He jumped out of the
vehicle, tucked a Steyr in his beltline, slung the Mossberg over his right
shoulder, a canteen over his left, and kept the other Steyr clenched in his
right hand. Then he walked to the hill he'd parked in front of. He took his
time climbing it, careful about making too much noise. As he reached its crest,
he moved the Steyr to the small of his back and belly-crawled the remaining
distance to its crown. He kept his head low, inching his way to the top until
his vision was unimpeded. He surveyed the land in front of him. Another hill.
Nothing to his left. Nothing to his right. He got up, slowly descended the
slope and then climbed toward the next crest. As he neared the top, he once
again pressed himself into the dirt and crawled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was heading east;
the wind was blowing west. As it pushed its way through the spare vegetation,
it brought with it a high-pitched whistling sound. And something else. Voices.
Muffled conversation coming from his right. It was broken and unintelligible,
but loud enough to tell him it originated from a point about a hundred yards
off. Then he heard another sound coming from his left. Not voices. Footsteps
pressing hard into the dirt and gravel on the east-facing slope just ahead of
him. They were quiet initially, but then became more labored, gave off more
sound. The same he'd made when he'd been climbing. He pressed himself further
into the dirt, but continued moving forward. He figured whoever was
approaching, they still had to be a couple of hundred feet away. And he was
near the top anyway, felt comfortable about his odds of getting a quick look
without being discovered. Once he determined who was approaching, he'd retreat
and loop around behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He crawled slowly over
the top of the hill, then risked his first glance. To his right, he could see
who was talking. It was the big guy, the boss, and another man. The boss had a
scope-mounted rifle, the man walking next to him carried a handgun. They were
engaged in sporadic conversation while they moved slowly toward the north side
of the hill. The big guy looked irritated, the other man less so. Both were
sweeping their weapons from side to side, scrutinizing every square inch of the
desert in front of them. He shifted his gaze to the left, saw two other men
making their way up the hill toward him. At first, he couldn't see their faces,
but as they moved upward, one of them looked up. The guy on the left. He
immediately recognized him. He recognized, too, that his plans would have to
change, and that his odds of getting out of the desert alive had diminished
precipitously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man on the right
approached with the self-assuredness of a guy who'd been on manhunts before,
like it was something he did for a living. And he was large. Not fat, just big.
Like a bear. He was decked out in army greens, coal black jump boots, a camouflage
baseball cap, and yellow-tinted sunglasses. He held onto a rifle with his left
hand, pawed at the ground in front of him with his right as he climbed. Clark
didn't recognize him, but he knew immediately the guy worked for the facility,
most likely with security. He didn't gather this from the man's bearing. And
not by the way he dressed, either. He knew because the man approaching on the
left was a prisoner. He stumbled along beside the larger man, face cut and
bruised, hands bound in front by nylon rope. When he had the luxury of stable
footing, he would glance to his left and right, looking as though he were
trying to find a means for escape. His face held a look of desperation,
bordering on resignation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>For a moment, Clark
wondered why they'd kept Tobias prisoner instead of just killing him. But he
already knew the answer: they were keeping him for interrogation. They needed
to ascertain who else knew about their operation. The future of their business
depended on it. If the knowledge of its location had spread, in an official
capacity, they'd have to go, cut their losses and set up shop somewhere else.
Otherwise, they could stay. And they'd have the luxury of either course of
action if they survived. Spread out as they were, Clark figured their odds of
living to see another day were pretty damn good. But they were odds he was
confident he could've beaten, if not for Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd originally planned
on engaging them in guerilla warfare throughout. It's an effective strategy for
operating against a larger force: he would strike and retreat, then repeat
until the only guy left was the boss. But now he couldn't do that. His best
guess was they'd brought Tobias to throw him off balance. They were banking on
a reaction from him, a full retreat at the sight of their hostage. Or at least
a protracted delay in his assault. And then the chase would be on. Three guns
against one, predators versus prey, and he wouldn't stand a chance. Not unless
he got really good at shooting over his shoulder while running away at a full
gallop. It was a decent strategy, and it might have worked, too. If he were
inclined to retreat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But he couldn't do
that. It wasn't even an option. Unless he wanted to die. The only logical
course of action would be to backtrack, swing around the left side of the hill,
then try to take the big guy out from behind. The downside was he'd have to
move fast, and he'd have to get close. With very little cover, that was going
to be damn near impossible. And there would be no using the Mossberg, either. Not
with Tobias so near the guy. He figured he'd get one shot with a handgun before
drawing the attention of the others. Then it'd be down to one guy against two,
the Mossberg against a rifle and a handgun. If the fat guy was any good, he
knew it would be a losing battle: scope on the rifle, safety in distance, and
the boss would have the luxury of taking considered shots at him as he moved to
draw the fire away from Tobias, giving the man a chance to understand what was
happening and move to safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He pushed himself back
from his position at the top of the hill, then pivoted to face the ravine. He
started his descent on his belly, ended it on his feet, every inch of progress
accompanied by mini rock slides and the noise of his boots slipping occasionally
on the steep, rocky slope. To him, it had all sounded too much like bombs going
off, but he knew he was in little if any danger of being discovered for two
reasons: one, his own heightened senses had undoubtedly amplified the noise;
two, the wind was blowing to the east, which would carry most of the sound he
made away from the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> He progressed
half-running along the ravine, making his way to the north side of the hill. As
he rounded the bend, he crouched, then moved to his hands and knees, then finally
his belly as he neared the spot he'd last seen Tobias. Then he used the same
strategy he'd employed when approaching the main buildings on the property:
he'd crawl a short distance, then stop to survey his surroundings. He'd moved
about thirty yards that way before he once again picked up the sound of their
footfalls. They were close, maybe fifty yards off. He dove into the dirt,
crawled a little further until he could finally see them. They were at his two
o'clock position, about half way up the hill. And Tobias was right in his line
of fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He lay motionless for
several moments waiting for an opportunity. But it didn't come. So he
improvised. All he needed was a little separation, just enough to get a shot
off. He scoured the ground in front of him until he found a rock about the size
of a silver dollar. He waited until the large man was looking up to the crest
of the hill, then sat up just long enough to throw it at his feet. He couldn't
have asked for a better reaction. The man heard the noise, turned, and pointed
his rifle just to the east of Clark's position. As he rotated, his shoulder
bumped Tobias, knocking the smaller man back a couple of paces. Clark quickly
raised himself into a crouching position, leveled the Steyr, then filled his
lungs with hot desert air. The large man caught his position. As he swung his
rifle toward him, Clark breathed out, then squeezed off a round.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He knew right away it
was a bad shot. It wasn't a miss, but from the man's reaction, it wasn't
exactly a hit, either: there was no rotation of his body, only the quick
movement of his right hand to his left shoulder, a motion most probably
associated with a scalding graze rather than flesh wound. As he pushed himself
back into the dirt, a blurred motion caught his attention. It came from his
left. It was Tobias. He'd capitalized on the shift of the big man's focus and
hustled toward him. The next thing Clark saw was Tobias grabbing the man's belt
and pulling him down to the ground. The sudden, unexpected impact caused the big
man to lose his grip on the rifle, which flew out of his hands and came to rest
about ten feet from where he lay. In the process, Tobias had opened up about
fifteen feet of separation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't think; he
just reacted. He grabbed the Mossberg, jumped to his feet, and started running
full speed toward the big man, who was about forty yards away. At thirty yards,
the man had recovered from his fall, was beginning to scramble toward his rifle
on his hands and knees. At twenty five yards, he had it in his hands. At twenty
yards, as the barrel of the big man's rifle was once again swinging in his
direction, Clark pulled the Steyr from the small of his back and threw it
toward Tobias. At fifteen yards, there was simultaneous movement of pump and
bolt actions. But the bolt action of the rifle had taken just a little longer
than the pump action of the Mossberg, and at twelve yards, it was over. The
shot from the Mossburg had scored a hit right in the center of the big man's
neck. Where his face had once been, there was now nothing, just tattered flesh
falling away from a decapitated body that staggered for a split second and then
crashed to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark hit the dirt, wary
of gunfire from the remaining two men, temporarily deafened by the thunderous
roar of the shotgun blast. He looked left toward Tobias, saw the man roll
defensively, then jump to a standing position. The handgun he'd thrown him only
seconds before was clutched in hands still bound by rope. A split second later,
he heard a faint pop, then Tobias was on the ground again. Clark shifted to his
left, then quickly moved to a kneeling position. As he scanned the desert in
front of him, he saw the guy who'd earlier been engaged in conversation with
the boss. He was lying on the ground, about fifty feet away, not moving, a
single bullet wound to the center of his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was only one
left, and it appeared Tobias was done playing good cop. Done playing any kind
of cop. Clark continued to scan the landscape in front of him, but saw nothing.
He looked back toward Tobias, just in time to see the man once again spring
into a standing position and squeeze off yet another round. As soon as he did,
he moved quickly to his left. A blast of dirt kicked off the desert floor at
his feet as he dove back to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The return shot ensured
Clark the boss was still alive, that he still had an opportunity to end things
his way. He figured, too, that this was his last chance to do something, take
some kind of action before Tobias knocked the man down for good. He quickly
resumed his face-down position, then rolled to his right and raised himself
into a prone stance, elbows firmly supporting his upper body, the barrel of the
big Mossberg pointing away from him, toward where Tobias had squeezed off his
round. Then he yelled out a command.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Toss your weapon
and come out where I can see you! You're outnumbered! If you fire again, you're
gonna leave this place in a body bag!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He looked briefly to
his left, saw Tobias dug into the ground, head facing his way, his eyes giving
him a look of incomprehension. Clark held up his index finger, then waved him
back with his hand. Tobias got the message, retreated slightly and fixed his
position just behind a squat boulder. Clark returned his scrutiny to the desert
in front of him, sweeping the barrel of the shotgun left and right. Just to his
left, about thirty five yards away, he caught a glimpse of the boss's head
behind a small mound of earth. He pumped the Mossberg once, chambering a round,
then pointed the barrel in a direction that wouldn't kill the man if he had to
fire. Then he re-iterated his warning, this time focusing his voice in a
direction that would let the boss know under no uncertain terms Clark had found
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Last chance, fat
man! You either drop your weapon and come out with your hands high, or I blow
you in two. Your decision!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Two minutes and one
well-placed shotgun blast later, it was over.</p>
