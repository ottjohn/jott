<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias rolled up
to the Hassenback residence a little after 4:30 in the morning. He stepped out
of his car into the warm, comfortable air that generally hangs around the LA
area in the early Fall. He took a deep, tired breath and listened. The din of
the constant stream of metro traffic sounded far off, supplanted by a chorus of
crickets, accompanied by the rhythmic beat of a few early-morning sprinklers,
an annoyed California Blue Jay taking a rough stab at lead vocals. He closed
his eyes and focused on the peacefulness, breathed in a total of two-minutes'
worth of nature's symphony before the angry gurgle of Sanchez's Mustang broke
the natural silence. He turned toward the sound and waited on the driveway as
Sanchez parked his car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So, how was
the drive?&quot; He asked as Sanchez approached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not bad. I
could get used to driving around this time of night ... morning.&quot; Sanchez
walked up to Tobias, holding a cup of coffee in his right hand, keys jangling
in his left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You have fun
with that. I try not to get up before the sun does. Speaking of daylight, I
have an appointment with a magistrate in Pasadena in three hours, so we need to
hurry. How 'bout you take the back part of the house, and I'll take the front.
We'll meet somewhere in the middle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds good
to me, boss.&quot; His reply sounded upbeat, but his face painted a different
picture. It was done up in more than a little concern, something Tobias had
seen many times before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's on
your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Must be
something, so you might as well tell me. And don't lie to me; I can tell, you
know.&quot; Tobias gave Sanchez a mock look of irritation, the same he
oftentimes gave his daughter when she needed to talk about something but felt
she couldn't. It always worked with her, and he'd found it worked just as well
on Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. It's
just that we need to have some kind of code word for early morning calls. You
scared the shit out of me, Tobias. I thought for sure something bad had
happened.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias saw that
Sanchez was smiling good-naturedly, but he could tell the kid meant what he
said. He was right, too. Late night calls are no fun. He took the keys to the
Hassenback residence out of his pocket, searched for the right one, and pushed
it into the lock. As he entered the house, he looked back at Sanchez and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds good
to me. How about 'Yo!'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez scratched
his chin, said, &quot;Hey, that's pretty good. You been taking Ebonics classes
again?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Gotta figure
out a way to understand you, don't I?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know what
you mean. I keep waiting for the community college to offer a class in
Colloquial Cracker so I can understand you. Bridge the gap, you know?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It is the
official language around these parts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;When are you
retiring again?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Soon as I
run you off the force. Then my job's done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
stepped into the house, the short, good-natured exchange providing the
necessary grease to get their mental wheels turning. As Sanchez headed to the
rear of the house, Tobias stayed in front and headed to the kitchen. As he
opened and closed drawers looking for Hassenback's designated bill repository,
he yelled to the other side of the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, you
have a chance to contact Rathman?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, as a
matter of fact, I did. Why is it everyone I know who knows you too seems to be
working on the weekends?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Because I'm
a magnet for hard work and productivity. What'd he say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not much.
They did run the query, but they got too many results, like more than 100
hits.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias whistled,
then said, &quot;Wow. That's a lot of big guys with victimized children.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I
guess predators don't keep those demographics in mind when they troll for
little kids, do they?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Guess not.
So what's the deal, then? How long until they get that list narrowed
down?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He said he
doesn't have an ETA. Same old crap from him. I kind of got the vibe he wasn't
too interested in sharing. Must not have taken that class in grade school. I
did, however, ask him for the local list he came up with. He told me he'd be
more than happy to get to me tomorrow ... or this morning, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. We've
got nothing on our guy. Might as well have a look. He said nothing about
running through it with FBI resources?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I asked him
about that. He told me he was crunching the list only as a professional
courtesy. Beyond that, he said the murder's local and everything else we have
is nothing more than speculation. Told me until there's stronger evidence
regarding kidnapping and a sex ring, the FBI couldn't officially get
involved.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias thought
about that for a moment while he opened and closed the last of the drawers in
the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Doesn't
sound right, kid. We have a dead body, former sex offender, with solid evidence
for a local sex ring. This sounds right up their alley. You'd thinking they'd
be chomping at the bit to take this one over.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not according
to him.&quot; Sanchez's voice quieted as he rounded the corner from the living
room to the kitchen. He walked up to Tobias, leaned against the counter, said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I told him
about the IP address you found in the phony marketing file from Hassenback's
thumb drive, told him the site behind it re-iterated almost word-for-word the
information in the file. I even went through why we believed the site is a
front for an organized sex ring that caters to pedophiles. He didn't sound
convinced, said it was probably just mock-up work for some small bank in the
valley. I asked him if he thought it might be a good idea to follow up on it
anyway, you know, given the nature of Hassenback and this Eduardo guy. He told
me if the FBI followed-up on every weak lead they received, they wouldn't have
the man-power to do what they were actually paid to do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;And what's
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez chuckled,
said, &quot;I was kind of wondering that myself, but I didn't ask, and he
didn't say. You find anything?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not a damn
thing. What about you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez shook his
head, said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, shit.
Magistrate's not going to be too happy with me wasting his time. You remember
anyone bagging mail for evidence?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't
think so. I don't remember.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Murder case,
it would seem the only thing they would bag is personal correspondence, leave
the bills behind,&quot; Tobias said, mostly to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Did you
check the trash?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. There
was some mail, but nothing from a phone company or an ISP.&quot; Tobias looked
at his watch, the dials on its face telling him it was 5:15 in the morning. He
mulled calling the department but figured he'd be going straight to work
anyway. No sense in asking a clerk to do something he could do himself in five
minutes. He doubted he'd find what he was looking for in evidence anyway. He looked
at Sanchez, said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Maybe he
uses wall plates to hide his bills too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez smiled,
looked a little haggard, the early hour beginning to catch up with him, run him
down like a slow-moving Mack truck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Doubt it.
What's next? Whatever it is, I'm gonna need more coffee before we do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We can go
back to the station and check evidence, but you know as well as I do what the
outcome's going to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yep. Better
to be thorough, though. Who knows, maybe one of the techs bagged it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, let's
hope so because that's all we got now, short of looking up and calling every
ISP in the greater LA area.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez frowned.
&quot;That would suck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're
telling me. Let's get out of here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
walked out of the house and into the morning air. It was still quiet, peaceful
even. Tobias closed the door behind him and locked it, then closed his eyes and
gave a listen for the angry Blue Jay he'd heard screaming earlier. He loved
birds, but he didn't particularly care for the Blue Jay. He found its obnoxious
character and incessant angry, squawk irritating, its genetic disposition for
thievery repugnant. Tobias stopped in his tracks. The word hung in the
foreground of his mind, shining with the cool light of a cheap neon sign: <i>thievery</i>.
It kept its position long enough for him to understand, then faded into
oblivion. He shook his head, cursed under his breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You
okay?&quot; Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I apologize,
kid. I should've never gotten you up for this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;S'ok. How
could you have known?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I should
have. I don't think the bills were ever here. At least not when the techs
arrived. Our perp took them. Thing is, if he's thorough enough to take the
equipment, he's certainly thorough enough to take the bills. Our theory's that
he's after information, right? That ISP bill is the kind of information he's
after. He might see it as a get-out-of-jail card. But it's not free. It's
risky. Information he'd use as a last resort. If he happens to have trouble
finding what he's looking for with respect to the hardware he took, he could simply
call the ISP, pass himself off as Hassenback, and try to obtain information
that way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked
down at the ground, smiling, then returned his focus to Tobias and said,
&quot;How the hell do you come up with this stuff?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;A little
birdy told me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez laughed,
said, &quot;Yeah? Well next time could you have your conversation with the bird
<i>before</i> you call me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll make
sure I do that. Let's go get some fast food and some coffee, I'll buy. Then I
need to get to the station. No sense in you coming. Go back to bed. All I'm
going to be doing is affirming the bill isn't there. After that I'm going to be
busy eating crow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez loitered
for a moment, turned around and took one last look at the house. He shook his
head, and started after Tobias, who was almost to his car. Then something
stopped him cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey,
Tobias.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What'd that
little birdy say about checking the mailbox?&quot; He hitched his thumb over
his shoulder at the mailbox hanging right next to the door. It was overflowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They found the
bill. It was sent from a company called The Orange Network, a local ISP
operating in Orange City, California. The search of the mail had burned another
15 minutes, and  the eastern sky was barely beginning to glow with a light-pink
hue that told Tobias he had about two hours to burn before his early morning
meeting with the magistrate. Too tired to think about pushing paperwork after
the quick drive-through breakfast he promised Sanchez, Tobias instead elected
to treat his understudy to a full breakfast and coffee at a local sit-down
establishment a block north of the station. After they ate, Tobias told Sanchez
to go home, nap for an hour or so, catch up with Rathman, get the local
suspect list, and meet him back at the station at around noon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He arrived at the
Pasadena Superior Court at seven in the morning, favoring an early arrival over
a an ill-advised gamble on LA traffic. He spent his half-hour wait looking over
Hassenback's ISP bill, reviewing notes he'd entered about the case in his PDA,
and entering new notes into the device regarding the more salient points he'd
include in his affidavit. When the appointment time arrived, the secretary, a
handsome, older woman with taste for Johnson-era attire, lead Tobias into the
office of magistrate Robert Michaels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels sat
behind his desk, elbows propped on its surface, chubby fingers steepled in
front of his face. He had short, thin, greasy hair, a large, bulbous nose, two
close-set bright blue eyes, and dark fleshy lips that held the remnants of a
recently-consumed powder donut. As Tobias, entered the room, the corpulent man
stood, his shirt almost bursting with exertion. He extended a his right, sweaty
paw, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You must be
Detective Tobias. I'm Robert Michaels. Pleased to meet you.&quot; His voice
was almost falsetto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nice to meet
you. Glad I could get on your schedule this morning. I know you must be
busy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, you
know just as well as I do, right?&quot; Michaels sat back down, his chair
protesting as he did. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I was hoping
you could help me secure a search warrant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Got the
paperwork?&quot; Michaels leaned back in his chair expectantly, wiped his hands
on his tie, adding to its burgeoning population of stains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias retrieved
his PDA, opened the file he'd been working on, and presented it to the
magistrate, who looked confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm sorry,
what's this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias blanched
slightly, knew this might be a problem. &quot;Sorry, sir. I had no time to type
an affidavit. I only found the target of the warrant a couple of hours ago, and
the evidence I might find there is extremely time sensitive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels looked
slightly irritated, rocked further back in his chair, clasped his hands atop
his ample belly, and said, &quot;I have to be honest with you, detective. I
almost never process a warrant unless I get some paperwork with it. Bringing
the paperwork shows a level of respect for the court, not to mention a level of
preparation on your part. Now, if you like ... &quot; Michaels looked through
his calendar on his desk. &quot;If you like, I can have Rebecca out there reschedule
you for later today, which will give you time to come back prepared.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias held back a
scowl, replaced his PDA in his pocket and stood. He looked down at the big,
round man in the chair, who was again busying himself with wiping his stubby
fingers on his maligned tie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;If that's
what you think is necessary.&quot; Tobias turned, started toward the door.
Michaels called after,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's not
what I think is necessary, detective. It's called protocol.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias stopped and
turned. &quot;There are times, sir, when rules need to be bent, if not
completely broken. There are some circumstances so compelling, so overwhelming,
that they demand immediate attention, even in the face of marginal preparation.
I'm sure your rules are important. Forgive me. I <i>know</i> they're important.
I have, after all, followed them for over two decades! But in my line of work,
sir, we're allowed to make judgment calls, especially when it comes to matter
of life and death. That must be the difference between our operational
processes. I understand. Your protocol is much too important to see it violated
by something as meaningless as the welfare of children or the life of a single
man.&quot; Tobias turned again toward the door, was reaching for the latch,
stopped, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Please
forgive my outburst. It's been a long couple of days. No sleep. If it's still
an option, I'll take that appointment for later today.&quot; He turned the
latch, pushed the door open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Stop. Close
the door detective.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias stopped,
turned around, and closed the door. He then raised a hand in front of him and
shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Listen, it's
been a really long day. I'm sorry about ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels
interrupted, his falsetto voice giving way to a more demanding pitch, eyebrows
furrowing into twin knots above his eyes. &quot;Children. What about
children?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said
nothing, just looked surprised. Michaels motioned him back to the chair, and
Tobias sat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll bend
rules, detective, if it'll help a child in danger. Rules be damned in that
case. Elaborate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Mind if I
just give you a verbal argument for the warrant along the way?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, we're
here, you've got my attention, so be my guest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias retrieved
his PDA from his pocket, used it for reference as he took Michaels through a
chronological history of the case, starting with Hassenback as a dead body and
ending with Eduardo as a potential victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So you're
saying there <i>could</i> be information at the ISP that <i>might</i> help you
identify this Eduardo fellow, who <i>could</i> be in grave danger.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's
correct, sir. The ISP handled Hasseback's internet connection. Hassenback
electronically corresponded with Eduardo. With any luck, then, there might
still be some evidence of those correspondences on the ISP's servers. Problem
is, many ISP's trash their logs and any deleted files after 60 days, and I'm not
sure about when the two last corresponded. With respect to this case, searching
those files in a timely fashion is going to make or break us.&quot; Tobias
leaned back in his chair, once again feeling uncomfortable about where the
conversation might be heading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I see. And
how is this going to help solve the Hassenback case?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias held back a
look of impatience. He'd never liked having to repeat things, especially simple
statements of fact. But in this case he knew better. He knew the magistrate was
repeating the questions to gain more clarity with respect to causality, knew it
would be much worse if he weren't re-hashing the questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Indirectly.
We think the guy who killed Hassenback is also in possession of the phony
marketing literature I told you about. Make no mistake, this isn't your regular
run-of-the-mill killer. He's very bright. If he does have that file, I'd bet my
next three paychecks he's also found the site associated with it. And if he's
come to the same conclusion we have regarding the purpose of that site, he's
going to be very interested in talking to Eduardo. The last person he visited
is dead, and I'm afraid if we wait too long on this, Eduardo's going to wind up
dead too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels stroked
his puffy chin with stubby fingers, mulling. &quot;Okay, I think you have cause
to search the Orange files to help you <i>prevent</i> a crime from happening.
Since you're going to use the fruits of your search to find and protect this
Eduardo fellow and leverage <i>his</i> resources to identify Hassenback's
killer, I'll grant another warrant on his residence when you find it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias shifted in
his chair, a look of relief washing across his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Now, about
the facility behind the website and the kids,&quot; Michaels started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes sir.
Again, there's no certainty here. But if we don't act, if we don't put some
resources on this, we'll never know for sure. I don't know about you, but I
don't think I'd ever sleep peacefully again knowing I didn't at least look into
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cart's
before the horse, detective. At this moment, there's not much to write a
warrant on with respect to that. Far as I know, everything you need is at the
ISP. Once you get me a direction with respect to <i>that</i> part of the case,
though, you come see me. I'll have the warrant waiting for you when you get
here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias smiled. The
conversation had started tempestuously, but he felt good about where it had
gone. Foe to ally in less than ten minutes. Not bad. He figured neither of them
had given the other the benefit of the doubt when he first walked in.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, sir,
you know we're hoping the Hassenback records will lead us to Eduardo. If
Eduardo uses the same ISP, which is a long-shot, I know, we can get an
additional warrant to scrutinize his activity. Between finding Eduardo and
collecting his transactional history, I'm confident that'll lead us to the
establishment behind the website.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Michaels placed
both hands on his desk, gripping its edge forcefully. &quot;That won't be
necessary. Once you establish they've been communicating, that the content of
their communication violates the conditions of their paroles or constitutes
criminal activity, you'll be able to drill into Eduardo's activities without an
additional warrant.&quot; He gave Tobias a wink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's good
to know.&quot; Tobias looked at the man expectantly, barely containing his
impatience to get legal machinery engaged and moving along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay!&quot;
Michaels sat up, seeming to get the hint. He looked at his watch, and then at
Tobias. &quot;It's almost eight in the morning now. Tell you what, you give me
an hour, and I'll have this ready for you to pick up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias left
Michaels to do his work, but decided to stay at the courthouse and wait for the
warrant, another morning decision based on California driving and its
inexorable disruption of time and space. Some places have weather. LA has
traffic. After picking up the paperwork at 8:45 in the morning, Tobias left the
offices of the Superior Court of Pasadena, got in his car, and headed in the
general direction of the ISP. As he was driving, he phoned Lieutenant Dursk
with the LAPD Computer Forensics Team and told him to have crew meet him at the
offices of The Orange Network, which was located in the southern part of the
City of Orange, on the 1100 block of Taft. A half hour later, Tobias stood
face-to-face with the Lieutenant himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Lieutenant
Dursk, I presume?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's
me,&quot; Dursk replied, the gravelly voice Tobias remembered from the previous
night's phone conversation sounding even rougher in person. He was a big man,
about a head taller than Tobias. He had short-cropped silver hair, a narrow
fish-like face, and a long, thin nose set below two piercing gray eyes. He
reached out and grabbed Tobias's hand, flashing a crooked smile as he did. His
smile was tightly surrounded by thin, wind-parched lips, teeth yellowed and
breath soured from a lifetime of smoking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias said,
&quot;Really appreciate you meeting me here. I know you must be tired.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm not
going to lie, Detective, it's a little past my bedtime. But when it comes to
this kind of stuff, getting the bad guys is a little more important than my
sleep, you know what I mean?&quot; He withdrew his hand, placed his thumbs in
the beltline of his over-sized pants, which hung off his frame like curtains.
He took a short tug on his cigarette, blew out pale smoke as he studied Tobias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You look
like you're a little worn out yourself. You slept at all since we spoke?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nope. Like
you said, no time.&quot; Tobias reached into his shirt pocket, removed a white,
folded document he'd stuffed there earlier. &quot;Here's the warrant.&quot;
Tobias handed the paperwork to Dursk, then said, &quot;Anything I can do to
help out? Speed this up a little?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man gave him a
surprised look, seemed to consider the request for a moment, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm sure
you're fully capable, detective, but that won't be necessary.&quot; He opened
the warrant, glanced at it briefly. &quot;Appears to cover what we talked about
last night on the phone ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It has all
the information you'll need. The search is centered around any files or
transactions directly related to Hassenback's activities on their network. I'm
sure that'll net you what you need to find Eduardo. In case Eduardo uses the
same ISP, the magistrate wrote the warrant to give you the latitude to follow a
reasonable evidentiary chain, which means once you find him, you have the freedom
to search records of his activities as well. Sort of an electronic version of <i>Plain
View</i>. Eduardo's definitely the missing piece here. We find him, we can put
a lot of the unknowns together and perhaps run this to a quick resolution. All
depends on us getting to him before our unknown does. He dies, our hopes for
solving anything with respect to this mess just might die with him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You really
think your perp is going to hit this pedo?&quot; Dursk asked, inflecting the
interrogative with the same doubt Tobias had heard over the phone the night
before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, I do.
No mistake, he's after a big fish, and he's been chomping on the small ones to
get to it. We figure Hassenback was just one in a line, and Eduardo is his next
most likely target.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You'd think
there'd be a trail of bodies if he were killing a bunch of pedos though, right?
Where's the other db's?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Unknown. We
figure he's been operating in a different part of the country until now. We've
been looking into it, but you know what it's like trying to piece together
information from disparate agencies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dursk gave a
bitter snort of disgust. &quot;Tell me about it. Well, as they say, we're
burnning daylight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave Dursk
a firm handshake, then turned away. As he opened his car door, the lieutenant
called after him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey,
sometimes these things go really slow; sometimes they go really fast. If
everyone in here cooperates and the storage gods are smiling down on us, this
can be finished in about a half a day. Keep your fingers crossed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Would it
help out if I sacrificed a yak in the parking lot here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dursk laughed.
&quot;I'd like to see that, but you'd probably get us into trouble with PETA,
in spite of your good intentions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, you're
probably right. I'll leave it to you then.&quot; Tobias got into his car,
closed the door, and slumped in the driver's seat. He was tired, hadn't really
slept since the night before. He decided to just stay put, catch a quick cat
nap. He figured it was going to be a long, busy day. It would turn out to be
the longest, busiest day of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo sat on the
floor shaking so badly he looked as though he were vibrating. Sweat was beading
on the top of his forehead, the hair closest to his face starting to dampen and
mat against his skin. He looked up at Clark, eyes wide open, filled with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I don't know
nothing about that. I swear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then why're
you sweating and shaking, Eduardo? You know what that tells me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo hung his
head so his eyes were looking directly at the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It tells me
you <i>do</i> know something. And I need that information. Make no mistake, you
will tell me. We can do this the hard way or the easy way. It's totally up to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo appeared
to think about what Clark had said, then gave him an incredulous look.
&quot;The hard way? What do you mean? Beat it out of me? That's police
brutality, something you can go to the slammer for, man. No way you gonna risk
that.&quot; Emboldened by his assertion, his expectation of reality, Eduardo
stood up defiantly, then patted his pants pockets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I need a
smoke. And you need to go. I don't need no more of your shit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said
nothing, just got up from the couch and approached the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. Get
your stuff and get out of here. You want to talk to me again, you can do it
through my parole officer ... or better yet, my lawyer!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark feigned
chastisement as he assessed Eduardo's posture: ram-rod straight, hands down to
his sides. Perfect. The course of the whole interrogation was now going to have
to change, and he'd need Eduardo in that position to quiet him down. One of the
worst possible ways to quiet a guy is to hit him in the face. Hit a guy in the
face, it hurts, and more times than not he'll yell out in both surprise and
pain, cause a commotion that can be overheard. Punch a guy in the solar-plexus,
though, you knock the wind right out of him, no air to scream. He figured a
quick gut shot would not only empty Eduardo's lungs, it'd probably knock him
out. That was good too because the rest of the interrogation would have to be
conducted with Eduardo restrained and under his complete control. He stepped
close to Eduardo and extended his right hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Guess you're
right. No hard feelings, huh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Eduardo reached
for his hand, Clark stepped forward with his left foot and landed a
right-handed blow to the center of the man's stomach. Eduardo doubled over in
surprise. All the air in his lungs gone, he struggled for oxygen and
consciousness. He took a weak step forward, his legs buckled beneath him, and
he fell to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stooped to
lift Eduardo off the floor. He was rolling his head from side to side and
breathing irregularly. His face was beet red. He was trying to moan, but he couldn't,
nothing but silent, choked gasps escaping his mouth. Clark carried him to the
kitchen and dumped him into a cheap plastic chair. As Eduardo slumped, eyes
struggling to focus, Clark went to his briefcase, opened it, and retrieved the
roll of duct tape he'd purchased the night before. He returned to the chair,
pulled off four strips, each 18 inches in length, and used them to secure the
man's arms and legs. He then pulled off a ten inch strip to cover his mouth,
pressing it firm against his skin to seal it shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Eduardo finally
drifted out of consciousness, Clark donned his paper surgical over-garments and
then searched for a vacuum. Given the condition of Eduardo's floors, he wasn't
holding out much hope. To his surprise, however, he found one in the lone
closet in the short hallway that lead to Eduardo's bedroom at the back of the
apartment. It was an older model Hoover with a bag, which was more than he
could ask for. He removed the vacuum from the closet, paused and considered the
floor again. It was a disaster, probably held DNA from dozens of people,
perhaps even the previous tenant. If he'd shed any DNA at all, it undoubtedly
amounted to very little and was more than likely lost in a sea of contaminants
that would take the police more time than it was worth to filter through. He
thought briefly of simply leaving the floor the way it was, then rejected the
idea. No sense in taking unnecessary risks. He unraveled the cord, plugged in
the vacuum, and spent the next 15 minutes removing layers grime from Eduardo's
floors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Satisfied he'd
sufficiently scrubbed the carpet of most of his biological markers, Clark took
the vacuum to the kitchen, unzipped the cover that held its bag, and removed
it. He searched for and found a steak knife in a kitchen drawer and used it to
slice the bag open lengthwise. He then retrieved his bottle of sodium hydroxide
and carefully turned and sprayed every piece debris in the bag, saturating it
with the caustic liquid. He placed the bag in Eduardo's oven, set the temperature
to 250, and let its contents bake. After a half hour or so, he'd be done with
the rest of the interrogation, the debris would be dry, and he could burn it in
the kitchen sink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He returned the
solution to his briefcase, trading it for his toolkit. He unzipped the black
leather pouch and removed a small Phillips screwdriver, then employed it to
remove the hard drive from Eduardo's computer. He then searched the desk, found
a secondary storage device and a notebook that appeared to hold the names and
email addresses of various people. He took what he found, stuffed it into a
heavy plastic garbage bag, and placed it next to the front door of the
apartment. He then turned his attention to a general search of the house for
any remaining electronic and tactile information, finding nothing he could use.
By the time he'd had wrapped up his search, almost an entire hour had passed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He once again
turned his attention to Eduardo, gave him a few open-handed taps to the side of
the face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Eduardo. You
in there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo's eyes
fluttered. He looked around, then noticed he was secured to a chair. He tried
to talk, but nothing but a low-pitched, vibrating mumble moved through the duct
tape over his mouth. Clark looked down at him, put his forefinger in front of
his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll take
the tape off, but you have to be quiet, okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo nodded his
head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;First,
there's something I need to set straight with you Eduardo.&quot; Clark took the
phony badge from his pocket, shoved it in front of the man's face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;This is a
fake badge, Eduardo. I got it from a toy store. I'm not a cop.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo simply
stared at him, eyes wide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I was a
father and a husband once. I had a loving family. But that was all taken away
from me. My daughter, her name was Jessica, she was abducted and taken to the
place I asked you about. She was raped repeatedly. They used her up, Eduardo,
and then they dumped my baby girl in the desert to die. You understand what I'm
saying?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo nodded his
head, his breathing beginning to turn ragged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good.
Because you're going to tell me where this place is, Eduardo. Here's how it's
going to work: if you yell out, I break a rib. If I think you're lying, I break
a rib. You ever had a broken rib?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo shook his
head, beads of sweat forming again on his brow, beginning to trickle down the
sides of his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Let me tell
you, it doesn't feel good. Every time you shout, sneeze, or cough, it feels
like someone is sticking an ice pick in your side. It's not pleasant.
Understand?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. Now,
look at me. Focus, Eduardo!&quot; Clark tapped the side of Eduardo's face
again, then grabbed his chin with a gloved hand and angled it up toward him.
&quot;I need you to do me a favor. I need you to calm down. You're not going to
do either of us any good if you wind up passing out by hyperventilating. This
can be really easy. You tell me what I need to know, and I won't break any of
your ribs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo nodded.
His breathing was still labored, but Clark could tell he was working to get it
under control. He reached for the duct tape, and gently removed it from his
face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo took a
ragged gasp of air, broken by intermittent sobs. He hung his head, took two
deep breaths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm so sorry
about your daughter. Please believe me. But I had nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm really
not sure how to respond to that, Eduardo. And it's really not what I want to
hear from you. Where's the place they took her?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tears began
welling up in Eduardo's eyes, his face molded into an expression of panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;They have a
van. All I really know is where they pick you up. That's all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;A place
called Baker out on the Mojave Highway. It's a dump, nothing there but fast
food, a couple of gas stations, and trash. Like I said, they pick up visitors
in vans, they're a sandy yellow color with markings on the sides that say <i>Desert</i>
<i>Tours</i>.&quot; Eduardo stopped, sucked in his breath, and started sobbing
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Keep
talking, Eduardo.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why? You're
gonna kill me anyway, right? Oh fuck, fuck, fuck. I can't believe this!&quot;
Eduardo shook in his chair, head down, quietly sobbing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I haven't
decided what to do with you yet.&quot; Clark answered honestly. He really
didn't know. The Hassenback kill had been easy, in the heat of passion. Eduardo
was different. He'd engaged Eduardo, wasn't really sure if he could kill him
now. Could he?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I went to
the place that killed your daughter. You're out for revenge, and I don't blame
you. You're planning on killing them, right? So why would you let me
live?&quot; His voice was ragged and stuttered, beginning to build in volume
and pitch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;For
information. Remember what I told you about crying out, Eduardo. Control
yourself. It's not my intention to hurt you, but if I have to, I will. Now keep
talking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo put his
face in his hands, wiped his tears, then took several deep breaths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, okay.
They do their pick-ups just to the east of a Shell station in town. They have a
couple of vans there. I arrived at the same time as two other guys. The pick-up
times are specific. That's how they operate. They make it look like a desert
tour that leaves at certain times of the day. So I parked my car and walked up
to one of the vans, the one with a driver in it. He got out, and we waited for
the other guys. When we were all assembled, the driver made all of us show ID,
and then he made us pay. After that, he put us in the back of the van. It was
windowless, so none of us could see out. Some of the roads were paved, some
were dirt. After about 30 minutes of driving, we were there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How much of
it was dirt road?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo took
another shaky, deep breath, looked up to the ceiling, mulled the question for a
moment, then said, &quot;Less than half. Maybe a third of the time we spent on
dirt.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark had passed
Baker before, knew it was a small town out in the middle of nowhere. He did a
quick calculation, figuring the average speed of the van to be no more than 40
miles per hour for the 30 minute trip. Given that, the place could be anywhere
within a 1200 square mile radius around the town. Not good enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're going
to have to do better than that. Which came first, dirt or pavement?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Pavement.&quot;
Eduardo coughed, then retched. Clark stepped back for a moment, let the man
recover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tell me
about the drive on the highway. Only one of two ways you can go out of Baker,
east or west. There's a grade heading west, flat land to the east. What do you
remember about that? &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo seemed to
focus on the empty space directly in front of him, then answered the question.
&quot;I remember. It was flat at first, then a grade.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark walked to
the couch, grabbed his laptop, launched his browser, and went to Google Maps.
He looked at the stretch of highway leading in and out of Baker from west to
east. As he suspected, the van had to have been moving east. The west side of
Baker was hilly, the eat relatively flat. Most of the trip, too, had to have
been on pavement, perhaps between 15 and 20 miles of it. He centered the map at
a location 17 miles east of Baker and zoomed. He found what he was looking for.
The only place east of town that had access roads into the surrounding desert
was right at a place called Halloran Springs Road. There was nothing else for
miles. Clark returned his attention to Eduardo. He had one more question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;When you
turned off the highway, did you make a left or a right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Left. I'm
sure we took a left. I remember looking out the front window of the van. We
were heading toward a hill. There are no hills to the south.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark smiled,
walked back to his laptop and closed it. He put the computer back in his
briefcase, then took the briefcase and set it next to the front door of the
apartment, beside the plastic bag he'd placed there earlier. Then he turned and
stood in front of the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thank you
Eduardo. You've been a great help.&quot; Clark held his ground for a moment. He
figured he could just clean up and leave. He could let Eduardo live. He didn't
really want to kill the man. He was different from Hassenback. Because of his
conversation with him, Eduardo had become human to him, a person. His life for
silence. He wondered if it would work, wondered if he should take a risk like that.
He continued to stand in front of the door paralyzed with indecision.
Simultaneous thoughts regarding what he should do began flooding his mind,
churning up conflicting recommendations that screamed within him, culminating
in a cacophony of high-pitched white noise. It pierced his head, sending
tension from his temples to the back of his skull. He closed his eyes, focused
on his breathing. After a moment, the noise subsided, replaced with an urgent
warning: he was wasting time and he had to get the hell out. He opened his
eyes, looked at Eduardo. He knew what he had to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo struggled
in his chair as Clark walked toward him. &quot;Hey! Are you going to leave me
like this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I guess I
can untie you. No sense you being in that chair anymore.&quot; Clark approached
to within a foot of where the man was sitting. He looked relaxed, much more so
than he'd been all morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Look
straight up at the ceiling.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eduardo seemed to
not understand the request, but, happy he was about to be released, complied
anyway. The stretch made his Adam's Apple stand out from the rest of his neck
like a overgrown knot on a small piece of soft wood. It was a perfect target,
and Clark delivered the blow with enough force to crush his larynx and
everything behind it. Eduardo had no idea what hit him, and in fact lost
consciousness almost immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark moved
quickly to the oven, took out the vacuum bag, and put it in the sink. He then
found one of Eduardo's lighters and  used it to set the contents on fire. As
small flames danced and lapped up at him, he removed his paper outerwear,
shredded the garment, and slowly added the ripped pieces to the fire. By the
time the contents in the sink had burned, Eduardo was dead, asphyxiated by a
crushed larynx. He returned to the front of the apartment, put his ear to the
door, and listened. Hearing nothing, he picked up his briefcase and the plastic
bag, opened the door, and walked into the early morning darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz took
his customary position at the head of an expensive solid oak conference table,
which was perfectly centered in relation to the meeting room's four towering
walls. Its surface sported a shiny, cappuccino-colored finish that reflected
everything around it like a large, dark-hued mirror. He could've simply
purchased a couple of card tables for the room, or even one of those cheap
pressed-wood jobs that low-class bank he worked for seemed to like so much. But
he didn't. As far as he was concerned, he was sitting in a war room; and a war
room, in his opinion at least, should be dressed up with appropriate
furnishings to remind its occupants of the grave nature of the business that's
conducted within its confines. You can't ask a guy to do great things, ask him
to work his mind until he bleeds through his eyes, and then park him in front
of a card table. So he spent a lot of money outfitting the room, then followed
that with a lot of time thinking about its function. That's because function
is every bit as important as form, even more important in his opinion. Function
lives in the details, and the details with respect to the room implied
leveraging available space to optimally facilitate planning. When he put the
room together, therefore, he decided each wall would serve a different purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The wall behind
him was used for planning asset acquisitions, the most critical and dangerous
part of his operation. It sported an eight foot square map of the greater
metropolitan area, marked up in several locations with red circles. Tacked into
the wall next to the circles were three-by-five cards that contained brief
product synopses. Affixed to the cards were smaller pieces of paper, each of which
presented a number between one and ten, signifying the product's desirability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The wall to his
right was almost completely covered by white-board. Marking up its surface in
black, blue, and red were various notes from previous meetings and ad-hoc lists
containing action items for future ones. Scrawled in red on the far right side
of the board was the beginning of a command hierarchy he'd started developing
during his previous visit. It reflected his first formulations for growing his
operation: get the chain of command down, recognize the holes in manpower, then
hire accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Affixed to the
wall in front of him was counter space that spanned the width of the room.
Created from a single slab of Italian Grigio Carnico limestone, its surface
looked like an inky black sky, uniformly broken by sundry-shaped clouds of a
rich cocoa color. The top of the counter was sparsely populated with a toaster
oven, a microwave, and a gourmet coffee maker. Below the counter were cupboards
containing supplies, mostly small snacks and caffeine to help keep energy
levels high during the sometimes marathon-long meetings he held. Built into the
wall above the counter was a rectangular display case that held various
keep-sakes collected from current and former residents of the shelter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the wall to his
left were several poster boards, each of which contained a summary, task list,
and progress status of projects specifically related to ongoing management
issues. The poster boards were presented in order of priority, the most
important of which were tacked on the wall nearest his position at the table.
The poster board closest to him today detailed a to-do list relating to the
security enhancements for the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz leaned
back in his chair, gave a nod to the two people in the room with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I've been
informed we've had some product turn-over.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He looked to his
left as he spoke, directly at Dave Manheim, his Chief of Operations. Manheim
was a frail-looking man of about fifty with delicate, bird-like features, grey,
collar-length hair that sometimes dripped grease, and a long hawkish nose, on
top of which sat a heavy pair of wire-frame glasses. Gerkowitcz hadn't really
liked the man when he first interviewed him, thought he was a little too
effeminate-looking, like a lot of those queers up in San Francisco looked. In
spite of his outward appearance, though, he had a great resume, the most
interesting highlight of which was his role as a Deputy COO for a Fortune 500
company. In the end, the qualifications had buried the reservations, and he'd
hired the man. It was a good decision, too: over the past year, Manheim had
repeatedly demonstrated he had a hell of a flair for keeping the business
running, even in the face of the enormous strategic challenges presented by its
day-to-day operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, we lost
an asset, which means we have five operational units left and no
reserves.&quot; Manheim's hands shook a little as he spoke, not out of
nervousness but from an unfortunate Parkinson's affliction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz nodded
gravely. &quot;Right. We can deal with that later. Let's get some other items
off the table first and then plan an asset acquisition after that.&quot; He
then looked to his right and asked,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's the
status of our ground security?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The question was
directed at his Chief of Security, Frank Malone, who was sitting directly
across from Manheim and presenting an exaggerated study in contrast when
compared to the diminutive man. Where Manheim was not much more than a leafless
twig, bent out of shape from time and malady, Malone was an enormous mountain,
a picture of health packed into a body that would tower over most. Standing at
just over six foot five and carrying about 250 pounds of chiseled muscle,
Malone looked every bit like a soldier-for-hire. While Gerkowitcz and Manheim
were decked out in casual business attire, the only style of dress each had
ever known, Malone sported pressed olive greens, jump boots, and a buzz-cut. He
wiped a trickle of sweat from his brow with a giant hand, then ran it down the
length of his bulldog face, stopping momentarily to massage the stubble on his
chin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;It's coming.
We have the cameras, motion detectors, and recorders. I included that in my
proposal, along with my recommendation we go with a liberal network. That means
more equipment, so we're going to be back-listed for things like battery-packs
and solar cells.&quot; Malone's deep, baritone voice almost shook the walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How much is
this going to cost me, Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Above the
150 grand we already spent? About another 100 grand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jesus Christ!
What the fuck are you buying, Frank? I read over your proposal, I checked the
numbers, I saw the product, but you need to help me understand why this shit is
so expensive!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Malone gave an
almost imperceptible flinch. Manheim peeped in, said, &quot;Actually, Dean,
while the cameras were the most expensive detail in the security plan, we did
get a really good deal. And you <i>did</i> tell us to operate under a liberal
assumption that our perimeter would be breached eventually. Given the proposed
plan, the spread of the devices will be no more than 25 feet all the way around
the most important parts of the property. That maximizes our coverage,
minimizes our risk, and necessitates the extra expenditure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Twenty five
feet, boss. Ain't no way anyone's gonna be able to even take a dump out there
without us knowing about it,&quot; Malone added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz leaned
back in his chair, rubbed the back of his neck with one of his beefy hands.
&quot;Two on one, huh? Fuck it. Buy the shit. That's what I pay you for anyway,
right? Better to be safe than sorry, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Malone and Manheim
said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How're we
coming with security for the power?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You didn't
notice?&quot; Asked Malone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Notice
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We got a ten
foot chain link fence perimeter around the windmills, barbed wire on top, and
the whole assembly's got juice on demand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. How
about the road?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's done
too, boss!&quot; Said Malone, now smiling. &quot;We finished last week. We have
three cattle guards on each switchback. Each of those is juiced, and each can
be dropped on demand to expose a ten-by-ten trench, making the roads impassable
to vehicles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What'd you
do about the crew who did the installations?&quot; Gerkowitcz was certain he
knew the answer, but wanted confirmation anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Closed shop
for three days,&quot; answered Manheim. &quot;Also, I made sure we hired
illegals. They don't complain, they like cash, and they always keep their
mouths shut.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good.
Nothing like the work ethic of a hungry Mexican, is there?&quot; Gerkowitcz 
looked up to the ceiling briefly, mulling the security equipment, thought of
one more question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's the
timeline for the ground cover installation? How long's the wait on the
equipment?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim answered,
&quot;The rest of the equipment should be in no later than the middle of the
week. It'll probably take us a day to retrieve it, another day to get some
labor for the installation, and probably a couple of days to plant it around
the perimeter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;After it's
in, I want it tested. Thoroughly. I'm spending this much money, it better work
flawlessly. I mean, if Jesus H. Christ himself comes on our property, I want to
fucking know about it.&quot; Gerkowitcz let it hang in the air for a moment.
Malone shifted uncomfortably in his seat, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nothing's
gonna be able to get by. If something's out there, we're gonna know about it.
Another thing: the perimeter will be large enough to give us about five minutes
to choose between fight or flight once it detects an adversarial
presence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz 
thought about that for a moment, said, &quot;Good to know.&quot; He then leaned
back in his chair and looked directly at Malone, who had begun to sweat again.
He knew he'd given the man a little too much shit over the security equipment.
But he liked giving Malone shit. Had since he met him. When he'd first taken
his job with the bank, Malone had been in charge of security there. During his
first day on the job, Malone had taken him around the property, ensured he knew
his way around. From there they'd exchanged daily nods, which quickly grew to
off-color jokes. A few months later, they'd evolved into drinking buddies,
patronizing various local bars most Friday nights after work. During one of
their alcohol-fueled discussions, he found Malone had been with the LAPD but
was terminated because he got a little too rough with the bad guys. So he'd
found his way into the corporate world where the adrenalin rush wasn't so high.
After about a year of drinking and jawing, they found they had a lot in common
and had become good friends. When the need for security presence on his
property arose a few years later, Malone had been a no-brainer. Gerkowitcz
smiled at the man, said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good job.
Now, I need you to round up our best two-man crew for asset acquisition. Tell
'em to stand by, okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sure thing,
boss.&quot; Malone eased back his chair, hefted his enormous figure upright,
and walked out of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz dropped
his head for a moment, rubbed his eyes with the balls of his beefy hands. He
was tired, he had a lot of work to do yet, and it was only four in the
morning.  He figured it was going to be a long day. And a dangerous one. Asset
acquisition was the greatest challenge to his operation, required tactical
planning based on permuted exigencies and circumstances that made what he did
at the bank look like child's play.  He shot an exhausted look at Manheim, who didn't
seem to be faring any better. He sat slumped in his chair, his hair unfurling
into a silver, wavy mess, his glasses sliding down his long hooked nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Ok. What the
hell happened?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well, I'd
like to tell you it was normal wear and tear, but it wasn't. This was a blatant
disregard for our property. Fact is, we've only had this one for two months.
Really good condition. Client got way too rough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Which one
was it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The client
or the girl?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The
girl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The
Brazillian.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Estanza?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. Sorry,
I can never remember their names.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz rubbed
his chin, his tired, bloodshot eyes now showing traces of anger. God damned
clients! He was going to have to figure out a way to screen them better. For
certain, most of them were well-behaved, even timid. Some of them, though,
thought they could come in here and beat the kids. They got off on the
violence, and he figured that had cost him a small fortune in lost revenue over
the past year alone. He fixed his gaze on the wall in front of him, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay.
Where's the client?&quot; His tone was carefully measured, even.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;With
Estanza.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tell me
how.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Malone did a
bed check after the client exited the room, saw the girl was beat up and
unresponsive. He walked to the service van, removed the guy, then sent the van
on its way. He then escorted the man to back to her room. When he re-emerged, 
they were both dead. He told me the girl still had a weak pulse, but there was
no way she was going to survive, so he put her out of her misery. As for the
guy, he slammed him in the neck with that metal pipe he keeps with him. Crushed
it. Took him about three minutes to die. After wards, we cleaned up, secured
the area, and locked down the remaining clients. Malone then grabbed one of our
staff, they put the bodies in one of the utility jeeps, and drove to the
abandoned pit west of here and disposed of them. From discovery to clean-up, he
followed protocol to the letter.&quot; Manheim raised one of his emaciated,
palsied hands to his mouth, and stifled a nervous cough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What'd you
do with the guy's vehicle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Malone and
an assistant caravanned to Bakersfield. Took it to a full-service wash, got it
detailed, then dropped it off downtown with the keys in the ignition.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz  nodded
and grunted. &quot;Okay, two things, Dave: We need better screening. We can't
lose fucking assets like this, God damn it. I don't know how we're going to do
it, but we have to eliminate those fucks before they even get here. Second
thing: we need to find a medical professional to put on staff. If we can get a
doctor here, we could keep our assets a little more healthy, make more money
off them, and minimize our risk by not having to go out so much on replacement
missions. Top priority, Dave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim furiously
scribbled notes on a legal paid, then said, &quot;I'll get right on it.&quot;
He then paused, let out a long breath as he smoothed his hair back into place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What do you
want to do about a replacement?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz pushed
his chair back, stood, and turned around. He let the forefinger of his right
hand skirt the various red circles on the map in front of him, pausing briefly
on three of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Looks like
we have two eights and a nine. One eight's in Santa Ana, one's in Ontario, and
the nine's in Riverside. Santa Ana's too close to me, Dave. Not sure if I even
want this one up here anymore. That leaves Ontario and Riverside. How many do
we have of color?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Estanza was
the only one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Gerkowitcz 
considered the cards pinned next to the two cities. &quot;Well, the girl in
Ontario is white; the one in Riverside's Hispanic. The girl in Ontario is ten;
the one in Riverside is eight. Not much of an age difference, really. How are
we doing for younger girls?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Of the five
we have left, the ages range between ten and twelve. Riverside would definitely
fill a demographic gap for us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, well
our last observation was ...&quot; Gerkowitcz looked more closely at the card
tacked next to Riverside, then continued, &quot;Last observation was less than
a month ago. She should still be there. Let's pick her up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim made a
note in his legal pad, looked up and nodded to Gerkowitcz, then asked,
&quot;Any preference on who does the job?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Up to
Malone. Go tell him who we're after, and see if you can get her here by
sometime tomorrow. I was supposed to be home tonight. As it is, I'm probably going
to be here for the next few days until this is done and she's integrated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim nodded
again, got up from his chair and walked around the table toward the door.
Before he could open it, Gerkowitcz said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Dave?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Double-check
his strategy. Make sure he's following procedure. Just between you and me, I
think he's great at security and breaking bones, but he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed, know what I mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll double
check it and make certain it's tight.&quot; He placed his hand on the door latch,
then paused. &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No. That's
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Manheim left,
leaving Gerkowitcz alone in the room. He spent the next hour making his best
attempt at re-engaging the budget for the next few months but failed. He was
tired. He got up from his chair, stretched, and decided to head to the guest
house for some much needed shut-eye </p>
