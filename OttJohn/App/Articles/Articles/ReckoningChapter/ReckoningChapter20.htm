<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The alarm clock let out
a pitched, electronic wail at four in the morning. Clark sat up, then pressed
random buttons on its illuminated control panel until the noise stopped. He'd
already been awake, had been for almost half an hour. Since he'd been a young
boy, he'd never had to depend on any kind of device to wake him. He'd used
alarm clocks before, but only as a redundancy measure in case the clock in his
head stopped functioning for some reason. But it never had. It always woke him
at precisely the time he set it, give or take five minutes. On big days, it
woke him a little earlier. And today was a big day, one of the biggest of his
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He shifted to a sitting
position on the edge of the bed, then took a moment to roll his head from side
to side, stretching the muscles in his neck, relieving the tension that had
built up in him over the past few hours. Already his heart was pumping with the
extra force from an adrenalin rush, bringing with it alertness, and a readiness
for what lay ahead. He'd been preparing for this day for two years, and finally
it had come. In just a matter of hours, he'd be an instrument of revenge; he'd
make good on a posthumous promise he'd made to his wife and little girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He pushed himself off
the bed, walked out of the bedroom, down the hall, and rapped on Tiny's door.
He listened carefully after the knock, heard a grumbling acknowledgement, then
turned and headed back to the bedroom, almost colliding with Carri as he made
his way through the doorway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good
morning,&quot; he said, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She looked up at him,
her eyes still partially glazed over from the previous night's slumber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm going to make
some coffee.&quot; She gave him a peck on the cheek and then moved sluggishly
down the hall, as if she were wading through water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He followed her with
his eyes until she disappeared into the living room. Even at four in the
morning, in her pajamas, multi-directional bursts of hair cast about her face
and draped over her shoulders, she looked like an angel. Beautiful. Exquisite.
He returned to the bedroom, quickly pulled on the same clothes he wore the day
before, then gathered up his briefcase and laptop and placed both on the bed.
He opened the briefcase and did a quick calculation, figured he had about 150
grand left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He removed just enough
money to make room for his computer, stuffing the excess banded, green bricks
into one of Carri's black, lacey pillowcases as he did. He guessed he'd
probably transferred fifty grand by the time he'd finished. That left him with
a hundred, which would be sufficient to start a new life if he were lucky
enough to finish what he was doing. He figured he would drive east, perhaps to
New York or Chicago, then blend in with the anonymous press of humanity that
such cities are known for. But he knew the odds of that were long at best. The
police had to know who he was by now. They'd look up the VIN on the engine
block of his truck, and a couple of keystrokes later, they'd have his identity
and a record of what happened to his family. Dead pedophile in the apartment.
His truck in the parking lot. It wasn't calculus. Three kills already, more on
the way. A jury might understand his motivation, but they'd be bound by law.
That meant life in prison, without parole. At least. But they'd have to catch
him first. Clark closed his briefcase, then turned to leave the bedroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He paused at the
doorway, turned. He took one final look around, telling himself he was only
making certain he'd left nothing behind. But he caught himself looking at the
bed. He was staring at two depressions, side-by-side, still imprinted on the
empty sheets. Images of the previous night's love-making moved through his
mind, a lifetime of hope, dreams, and promises all burned up in a single
passionate hour. A gust of wind drew his attention to the open window. It
shifted the air in the room, washed him with the perfumed scent of an
impossible future. He breathed it in, burying the fragrance deep within his
lungs. He exhaled slowly, took another deep breath, then turned and left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark walked into the
kitchen, found Carri and Tiny making small talk between hungry sips of strong,
aromatic coffee. Carri moved to the counter as he approached, picked up a large
mug of morning brew, and extended it to him. He noticed her hands were shaking,
saw Tiny noticed too. Tiny looked at Clark, said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm gonna wait
out by the car, bro. Need to make sure it's ready to go, know what I
mean?&quot; He drained the rest of his coffee, placed his mug on the counter,
then turned to Carri.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks for the
hospitality.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri nodded an
acknowledgement, then she and Clark watched the enormous man make his way
through the living room and out of the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So where'd you
find him?&quot; She asked, gesturing with her thumb toward the living room.
&quot;He's as big as a truck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They both knew it was a
strategic question, delivered in a desperate attempt to distract from the
elephant crowding the room. Clark searched her eyes, saw behind the fatigue,
recognized a look he knew all too well. He'd seen it in the mirror every day
for the past two years: a look of emptiness, a reflection of a soul hollowed
out by the death of a dream. Suddenly the energy he'd felt earlier, the sense
of purpose welling within him, started to drain away. He placed his coffee mug
on the counter, closed the distance between them, and caught her up in his
arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
he whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri remained
motionless, her forehead against his chest, her vision cast down to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I want you to
understand something: I've been walking down a very bad road for some time now.
My life was full darkness until I met you. You allowed me to feel again, to
experience emotions I didn't think were possible for me anymore. Hell, I even
caught myself smiling yesterday.&quot; He paused, kissed the side of her head
gently. &quot;Maybe I should've pushed you away. Maybe allowing something to
happen between us was wrong. But I'll never regret it. And I'll never forget
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri nodded weakly but
otherwise remained motionless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark hesitated, then
said, &quot;Can you do one more thing for me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm sure there's
going to be children where I'm headed. I'll give you a call when it's done.
I'll stay until you arrive. Someone needs to be with them. Someone they can
trust. Can you do that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I have to go now.
I'll call you as soon as I can.&quot; The words moved through his mouth like
stones. Heavy ones. There was no doubt in his mind that saying goodbye to her
was one of the most difficult things he'd ever have to do. He turned to leave,
started walking toward the living room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Jack?&quot;
Carri's voice cracked just a little, betraying a monumental struggle to keep
her part of the goodbye under control. He turned, found her standing in the
same spot, head still lowered, shoulders heaving slightly. He put his briefcase
on the floor, then walked to her and took her in his arms again. He buried his
face in her hair, breathed in her scent, then lowered his mouth to her ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I know,&quot; he
said. &quot;I feel the same way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark held onto her
tightly. He didn't want to let go. He wanted to hold her forever. Because it
felt so right. Like home. But he couldn't. He had a promise to keep. The
embrace lasted a moment longer, then he kissed her on her forehead, turned to
collect his briefcase, and walked out of the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark walked down the
driveway and onto the street where he parked his truck. He opened the front
passenger-side door, placed his briefcase on the floorboard, then headed toward
the Mustang, looking up at the sky as he walked. It was clear, the stars dimmed
by the overwhelming presence of a gibbous moon that cast just enough light to
make the streetlamps running up and down the neighborhood superfluous. The air
had a calm, chilly dryness to it, a signal that told him nothing about the
weather would change much but the temperature. As he passed between the
vehicles, he caught a glimpse of light falling out of Carri's front window. It
was quickly obliterated by a large, dark figure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You okay,
bro?&quot; Asked Tiny, cocking his massive head to one side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He paused for a moment.
&quot;Yeah, I'm fine.&quot; Then he gave Tiny a hard, calculating look.
&quot;What about you? You sure you want to go through with this? I appreciate
where you're coming from, but you've got to under ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny interrupted,
&quot;I told you las' night. I want in on this. I need to be. For my little
sistah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark wasn't convinced.
Up to this point, Tiny had been nothing more than a distraction, something he'd
tolerated the previous night as a way to obtain hardware. But distractions have
a bad habit of becoming disruptions, and a disruption could slow him down,
compromise his ability to complete what he set out to do. On the other hand, if
Tiny were up to the task, he could prove to be an invaluable ally. The place in
the desert remained an enigma: he had no conception of its layout or how well
it was defended. Tiny could provide an extra set of eyes and ears, could shift
the odds of a quick, deadly hit in his favor. But he had to be sure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You need to
understand something, Tiny: the police <i>know</i> who I am. They have my
truck. They more than likely know where I'm headed. Hell, they could even be
there when I arrive, waiting for me.&quot; Tiny looked as though he were going
to interrupt again, Clark held up a dismissive hand, and continued. &quot;I've
found the operation that killed my little girl, Tiny. I don't care who's there.
The police, the FBI, the God Damned National Guard. It doesn't matter to me.
I'm going to find a way in, and then I'm going to kill every one of those
fuckers. I'm willing risk my life, to die, to get this done. And I'm okay with
that. Are you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't care who
there, neither, bro. This shit been burning in me for ten years. It's time I
did something. May not be the niggas who took my little sistah, but it's
principle.&quot; Tiny paused for a moment, then looked at Clark with fixed
determination. &quot;This is <i>principle</i>, man. Ain't no way I'm gonna find
that nigga who did that shit. I know that. But I can do this for her and help
those kids out there in the desert? I'll lay down for that. Cops or no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark nodded, now
convinced. He looked at the rear of the Mustang, said, &quot;Before we leave, I
need to see what we have in the way of weapons. Then we're going to have to
split it up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny cocked his head to
the side, remained standing in front of him. Clark understood the hesitation,
answered his question before Tiny could even ask it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm okay with you
coming along. I have no plans to lose you along the way. In fact, I'm grateful
for the help. But if we get separated, or if one of us gets pulled over, we
have redundancy this way, okay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny said nothing, just
nodded in agreement, turned, and walked to the rear of the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark stared into the
open bag, took a quick inventory, then shook his head and grunted. Whoever they
found themselves up against in the desert, they'd have to be armed to the teeth
to match what he was looking at.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Lying lengthwise
against the rear of the bag were two Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotguns. Clark
removed one and held it up for inspection: black stock with a pistol grip,
six-shot pump action, eighteen and a half inch barrel, muzzle break to kill
recoil. They were civilian facsimiles of their military counterparts, passed
all of the same stringent tests the military threw at their hardware. And they
were deadly, could blow six men in half at ten yards in just under ten seconds.
In theory. If the shooter was quick enough. It was a matter of turning three
actions into two, a matter of converting <i>pump</i>, <i>point</i>, <i>shoot</i>
into the more fluid <i>pump and point</i>, <i>shoot</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the middle of the
bag were four Austrian-made combat pistols. Steyrs, 9mm. Clark had field-tested
some of them years ago when he was in the military, mostly for comparative
analysis against the U.S.-favored Glock. The particular model he was looking at
hadn't been in production since 1988. They were a decent gun, however: they
were made from carbon steel, had a plastic grip, and a sixteen round. They also
featured a gas-retarded blowback design, a mechanism for dispersing the gas
released upon firing to minimize vertical muzzle rotation. Which made them
deadly accurate at close range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the long side of the
bag closest to him was a sniper rifle he'd read about but had never seen. It
was a Russian-made Vintorez, lovingly called the Vinny. It was the combat
weapon of choice for Ukrainian special forces that found themselves in
high-risk operations requiring stealth. The rifle was short, only about a yard
in length, which diminished its range to about 400 yards. But it wasn't made
for long kill shots. It was a medium-range sniper rifle specialized in pushing
its 9mm payload through flesh and light body armor. Drops the enemy like flies;
keeps the shooter comfortably away from the action. The rifle had a selector
for either automatic or single shot, came with a ten-round box clip, and the
entire length of the barrel was wrapped with an integrated silencer to ensure
its rounds were fired with deadly, muted pops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark shook his head
again, then just stared at Tiny in the darkness. &quot;Where the hell did you
get all of this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The hood, man.
Where you think?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;There must be
some serious fire power running around South Central. Gang warfare must be
getting pretty sophisticated, much more so than I read about in the papers,
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not really.&quot;
Tiny answered. &quot;Most is still handguns and knives. All this shit here
...&quot; Tiny motioned to the bag. &quot;All this shit come from some stupid
Russian punks thought they's gonna take over the block, bring in a heroin
operation. Long story short, we took 'em down one by one, took they house,
collected they hardware, burned they shit so it didn't get picked up and sold
by some other punks.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thank God for
stupid Russian punks. Let's split this up. You got any sniper experience?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny shook his head in
the darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Wasn't my primary
job description, but I ribboned in the Army. Kept it up during and even after.
Became a hobby.&quot; Clark paused, waited for an acknowledgement, got none.
&quot;I'll take the Vinny, one shotgun, and two of the Steyr's.&quot; Clark
moved his hand around the inside of the bag. &quot;Where's the ammo and the
scope?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Zipped up on the
side.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Tiny opened the side
compartment on the long end of the bag, Clark took the Vinny and one of the
shotguns and moved them to his truck, placing them together under the rear
bench seat. He then took the handguns, placed one under the driver's seat and
the other in the center console, which was empty, save for sixteen cents in
loose change and a receipt for Chinese take-out. On his final trip to the
Mustang, he found Tiny holding the scope and three bags of ammunition. He handed
them to Clark, then asked,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Head out. We have
a lot of ground to cover, and I want to be there before the sun's fully up. We
need to hit a store on the way, though, so keep your eyes peeled.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What more we need
than what we got, bro?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Specifically,
three canteens and some powdered laxative. We're also going to need some
supplies. I'd like to say we can finish all of this in a day or two, but who
knows.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny cocked his head,
smiled a big, toothy, Cheshire grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Three canteens?
And laxatives? You a little irregular?&quot; He laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nope. I'm
functioning just fine. Two of the canteens are for us, the third and the
laxatives I have other plans for.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Whatever you say,
bro.&quot; Tiny closed the trunk, started heading toward the driver's side of
the car, then turned back to Clark. &quot;Since you know where you're goin',
I'll follow you. Just in case, though, which way we headed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know how to
get to the 10 from here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I live in L.A.,
man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Right. Head to
the 10, then go north on the 215. Take that to the 15. In case we get
separated,  let's plan on meeting up outside of Victorville. You got your
cell?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny said nothing, just
reached in his front pocket with one of his meaty hands and presented a little
flip phone. It looked like a postage stamp affixed to the center of his palm.
Clark gave him his number, Tiny punched it in. Less than a minute later, they
were on their way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias met Sanchez at a
place called Molly Brown's County Cafe, a breakfast establishment right in the
heart of Victorville, just off the 15. They sat on opposite sides of a booth at
the front of the restaurant, next to a giant plate-glass window that gave them
an unimpeded view of the vehicles and foot-traffic moving up and down Mojave
Boulevard. Tobias had a map of Baker and the surrounding area spread out in
front of him, which he'd strategically placed between two heaping plates of
food and two cups of strong, freshly-brewed coffee. He was busy tracing his
fingers along the streets of Baker, paying particular attention to the town's
northeast corner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think our best
bet's right here,&quot; he said, pointing to the part of town he'd been
considering. &quot;Looks like this area provides the easiest access to the 15,
and it appears to be the most industrialized and anonymous part of town.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez scoffed.
&quot;Yeah, if you can call anything about that place industrialized. So you
want me to focus my search there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Not necessarily,
but let's start there first. Maybe we can save a little time that way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez added cream and
sugar to his coffee, stirred it, took a sip, then followed up with a shovel
full of scrambled eggs and hash browns. He took another sip of coffee and
smiled across the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Can't beat a
greasy breakfast. This'll probably get me through the rest of the day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked up from
the map, said, &quot;Glad you're enjoying your breakfast. What do you think of
starting on the east side of town?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sounds like cake
to me, boss. Whaddya say we get the show on the road so we can take these
creeps down?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took a sip of
coffee then shook his head. The kid appeared to be a little too comfortable,
perhaps still riding high after his identification of Clark the night before.
Coolness in a high-stress, potentially dangerous environment is without
exception a good thing. Overconfidence, on the other hand, is something to be
avoided, something that could get a guy killed in their line of work. He gave
Sanchez an appraising look, no different from the look a father might give his son
just before his first solo road trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Now, you tell me
exactly what you're <i>not</i> going to do when you get there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez caught the
measured stare, appeared to process the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm not going to
stay in any one place for long. I'm not even going to get off my bike. If I
find the business, I'll memorize the street address; if I find the vehicles,
I'll memorize one of the plate numbers. Then I'll immediately ride out of the
area, park, and phone the information in to you. Good enough, dad?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I hope so. I
don't want any cowboy stuff, kid, so don't dive into this like we're going to
make any arrests today. We know nothing about these people, have no idea how
they might react if they feel threatened. Remember, there are only two of us,
and we <i>are</i> in the desert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias noticed the
kid's chest was heaving slightly; a vein protruding from his left temple
betrayed an elevated heart rate. He looked a lot like a race horse, foaming at
the mouth, pressing against the gate, restless to run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Be patient, kid.
Let's just stick with the plan. If you find something, we'll play our game on
the highway, wait for one of their vehicles to show, and hope it leads us to
the main operation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;In the meantime,
wanna find out how fast that geriatric cruiser can go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't even think
about it. I need you in one piece, not broken up and scattered all up and down
the Mojave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez shrugged, then
looked down and considered his plate of food, which was still about half full.
He lifted his fork for one more bite, then thought better of it and abandoned
the meal. He took a sip of his coffee, then brought up a concern Tobias was
waiting for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Using the bike
for surveillance is a good idea, but it's still got to be a little suspicious
out there in the middle of nowhere. If I run up and down those roads too many
times, people are going to wonder what I'm doing. And if it's the wrong people
wondering ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Already thought
of that. More times than not, the simplest solution to a problem is always the
best one. I'll give you the map as soon as we're done here. If you think you've
been spotted, take it out. Play if off like you're lost. They see that, they
won't think anything of it. You're just a guy out in the desert trying to
figure out where the hell he's going. On the outside chance that doesn't
convince them, don't give them an opportunity to get close. Just get out. I
really doubt it will come to that, though. Baker is small, and you won't be
there for long. At least not long enough for anyone to really notice you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias drained the rest
of his coffee, figured Sanchez understood the need for a low-key approach. At
least he hoped the he did: the last thing he wanted was to get involved in a
war of wills against an opponent he knew nothing about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Ready?&quot; He
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Born that
way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Then let's
go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark tried to relax as
he drove into the desert, but he found it difficult. The surplus downtime
caused his mind to stray from what he should've been focusing on. Instead of
thinking about strategy and contingencies, he was inundated with thoughts of
his daughter, his wife, and Carri. Individually, and even together, they were
certainly topics worthy of contemplation. But not when he needed to focus on
his destination, not when he needed to have his emotions completely in check,
and definitely not when he needed to be mentally preparing for the most
important battle of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As the miles clicked
by, he found it easier to concentrate. He eased his mind into a more
contemplative gear by first making a mental checklist of the things he and Tiny
had brought with them. He interrogated the list until he got bored with it,
concluded they were adequately equipped to make it a few days in the desert
without having to resupply. As he neared Baker, he was in the middle of running
through various surveillance and assault strategies, applying them to a two-man
crew, armed to the teeth, while confronted with a harsh, dry climate and an
unknown enemy. In his opinion, the best offensive strategy for a two- man crew
would be to break it up into two one-man units. Going in together as a paired
force didn't make any sense to him, and he hoped Tiny would agree with him on
that issue. It halved their odds for success. If the place had security and a sniper
who was any good, they could both be dropped in the blink of an eye. Better to
split up, then take the place from two different directions. If that were even
possible. He wouldn't know until he got there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He drove past the Baker
exit, figured he'd give it fifteen miles before turning around. Based upon what
Eduardo had told him, that would be the most probable distance for the turn-off
into the desert, where he'd expect dirt roads and hilly terrain. Eight miles
later, he found what he was looking for: an exit onto a surface street called
Halloran Springs Road. And the probabilities were high, too: hills to his left,
a road leading right into them, changing from asphalt to gravel as it moved
away from the highway and injected itself into the harsh desert landscape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He turned on his right
blinker, then stepped on his brake pedal lightly several times to get Tiny's
attention. He pulled off the 15, took a right on Halloran, then followed it a
few hundred yards to a dilapidated assortment of four buildings scattered about
on a gravel lot. He parked at the end of a line of ancient metal heaps,
rusted-out clunkers that hadn't been modern for four or five decades.  Tiny
filed in right after him, parked the Mustang just far enough away from the
truck's passenger side to allow the doors of both vehicles to open without
touching. He transferred his equipment to the truck, locked the Mustang, then
hopped into the passenger seat of the big F-350. Less than five minutes later,
they were on an anonymous dirt road, winding their way into the hills east of
the 15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark drove slowly to
ensure he didn't miss any barely-visible crossroads. The terrain was
acceptable, presented an occasional challenge, but nothing that required
four-wheel drive. As he the road turned around a small, scrubby hill, he
decided they were close enough to warrant an elevated level of caution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Based on what I
was told, we're getting close. I doubt anybody's going to come running toward
us with barrels blazing, but just in case, why don't you get out the Mossbergs,
load them up, and retrieve a few extra shells for the both of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny drawled, &quot;Yas
sah! Massah Clark!&quot; He leaned over, inserted his bulk between the
captain's chairs. Clark saw he had to twist himself sideways to do so,
over-grown lat muscles wedging against both seats, a massive arm appearing and
then disappearing as he retrieved the shotguns and the bag of shells one by
one. He'd always considered himself a big man, but compared to Tiny, he figured
he must have looked like a twig.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Tiny loaded the
shotguns, Clark said, &quot;Didn't intend for that to sound like a command.
Just getting a little edgy given the proximity to our target, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny looked over, a
large toothy grin spread across his face. &quot;Prah-sim-uh-tee? Woo-wee! Yo
shore does use big words, boss!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Stop.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just havin' a
little fun, bro. Might as well, you know what I'm sayin'? Cause we find this
place, it gonna get a whole lot less fun real quick.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't answer,
just stared out the driver's-side window into the desert. Tiny followed his
gaze, then let out a low chuckle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;And it looks like
it's gonna get a lot less fun sooner than I 'spected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark was looking down
an access road that zigzagged its way to a barely-visible collection of
buildings set up against the base of a hill. The road was bordered on both
sides by mature cottonwoods. The hill was crowned with six windmills, turbines
spinning slowly in the barely-moving morning air, moonlight bouncing off
enormous metal blades. He found himself breathing more deeply, a process that
had become automatic to him over the past couple of years, an exercise that
allowed him to maintain his cool and mentally prepare for an engagement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He slowed his truck to
a crawl, said, &quot;That's it.&quot; An image of his daughter suddenly flitted
through his mind without warning, his heart rate jumped, and a brief surge of
rage coursed through his system, turning his face an angry shade of red. He
gripped the steering wheel tightly with both hands, his knuckles turning white
under the pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny placed a meaty paw
on Clark's shoulder. &quot;You okay, bro?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I'm
good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What now? Can't
stop here. Too obvious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We find a place
to park up ahead, stash the truck. Then I'm going to backtrack. I want to get a
better look at the compound from the front, see who's moving about and watching
the place. Then I'm going to evaluate their defenses and identify any weaknesses.&quot;
Clark felt the color drain from his face. He took a few deep, silent breaths,
did his best to banish the unproductive thoughts from his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tiny removed his hand.
&quot;What you want me to do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You tell me. How
do you think you can help best?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yo, man, I'm from
the hood, dog.&quot; Tiny laughed nervously before continuing. &quot;Gimme a
crack house or even a bad residence infested with some even badda niggas, an'
I'll move in like a cat. But this? We out in the desert 'n shit.&quot; He
paused. &quot;I guess I'd wanna move around the rear, use the scrub and the
terrain for cover, then look for safe zones and potential assault paths.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said nothing,
just gave the man a surprised look. Tiny was holding back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You ain't the
only one who been in the military. Semper Fi. Grunt, but I paid attention to my
training. How the hell you think I beat all them niggas back home, bro?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark nodded his head,
felt more than a little relief he wasn't going to have to a explain a
split-assault strategy to the big man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Take a Mossberg
and a Steyr. Right now, let's focus on observation only, get the lay, identify
security and weaknesses.&quot; Clark reached into the center console, removed
the two-way radios he'd purchased earlier in the morning, handed one to Tiny.
&quot;Channel Five. Let's keep in contact about every half hour. Two clicks,
that's it. You find yourself under duress, get the hell out and meet at the
truck. Three clicks for duress, okay?&quot; Tiny nodded his head. Clark
reiterated, &quot;No action yet. Just surveillance. Let's try to give it eight
hours. After that, if everything goes well we'll regroup at the truck, drive
further out into the desert, get some rest, and come back about three or four
in the morning and take the place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They drove in silence
for another two miles. The road slowly degraded from fairly maintained to a
rutty, sandy mess that required traction on all four tires. Clark drove a
little further, to a point where he figured not too many vehicles would
venture, then followed it a half mile more to the far side of a squat hill. He
parked his truck just off the road, effectively concealing it from any vehicles
that might approach from behind. They stepped out of the truck, let the silence
continue as they geared up. Canteens freshly filled with water, fanny packs
loaded with spare shells and snacks, they headed in separate directions:  Tiny
into the desert behind the compound, Clark back down the dirt road toward its
front.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gave Sanchez a
quarter mile head start, then followed him north on the 15 through Barstow and
then west toward Baker. During the drive, he decided to focus on aspects of the
mission that could go wrong. He concluded if they just played it safe, they
could accomplish everything they set out to do: identify the facility in
question, establish its relationship to Desert Tours, then return to Pasadena
to use that information as foundation for a warrant. In principle, it sounded
like a good plan. In reality, it was susceptible to annihilation by two wild
cards: an unintentional mistake made by an overconfident partner, and an
untimely appearance by the man they were after, one Jack Clark. He'd done
everything he could to prevent the former; there was nothing at all he could do
about the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As his cruiser sliced
through the cool, early morning air, he allowed his mind to move from
work-related hypotheticals to a more relaxing introspection of the desert. He
took in its expanse as he drove, found it amazing it could sustain any life at
all given the lack of moisture and the oppressive heat that baked it into
oblivion nine months out of the year. He kept his mind busy by trying to
identify the various desert plants as he sped by them. That turned out to be a
mistake. He caught a glimpse of a Spiny Saltbush, and he was suddenly thrown
back into the nightmare he'd had the previous evening. He could see Samantha
lying in the desert sun under the frail piece of scrub, her hair flowing away
from her body with the wind, ash gray skin marked up here and there by rips and
tears, the systematic work of a menagerie of vermin and decomposition. He could
smell the putrefaction, hear the steady, overwhelming buzz from the dense cloud
of flies feasting on her body. His heart sped up, his skin flushed, and he
began to sweat. He wanted to pull over. He gripped the wheel of his cruiser
with both hands, took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Then he took another.
He tried to convince himself it was just a dream, nothing more than a random
collection of thoughts, built off a foundation of concerns he'd had over the
past several days. But he knew better. The dream served a purpose. It raised a
question. A very personal one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>What would he do</i>?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How would he react if
he found the person responsible for raping and killing his only granddaughter?
He tried not to think about it, but he couldn't help himself. He found his mind
wandering inexorably toward an honest contemplation of the hypothetical,
vectoring in on self-truths he knew were better off left in the more primitive
parts of his brain. He was bracing himself for an ugly revelation, a bit of
primal self-knowledge, when something caught his attention out of the corner of
his eye. A van. Merging onto the freeway in front of him. It was a large,
sandstone-colored vehicle, and painted onto the left panel in bold print were
the words <i>Desert Tours</i>. He'd been so caught up in introspection he'd
almost driven right by Baker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He scanned both sides
of the road for Sanchez but couldn't find him, figured he must have already
turned off the highway and was heading into town. He slowed his cruiser just a
little, considered turning around, then quickly dismissed the idea. He sped up
until he matched the speed of the van, eased his way into a position about a
half mile behind it. Using the traffic spread out between them to obscure his
presence, he followed it for about eight miles until it exited on Halloran
Springs Road. He didn't pull off the road with it. He simply drove on, watching
his rear-view mirror as he passed to determine which way it would turn. It
disappeared momentarily as it rumbled down the off-ramp, then came back into
view just in time for him to see it take a left, then head into the hills on
the east side of the highway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He drove another couple
of miles before he found a suitable spot on the median to turn around. As he
pulled his cruiser into westbound traffic, he retrieved his phone and dialed
Sanchez. No answer. He picked up his speed, watched for the van as he once
again made his way toward the Halloran exit. It had moved beyond the blacktop,
was now on an unimproved dirt road that appeared to wrap around a little hill
and then disappear into a shallow gorge. He slowed as he approached the exit.
The van was about a mile from his position, rocking and sliding up the road.
Too close to turn in after it, he sped up again, decided to return to Baker to
find Sanchez. Five long minutes later, he pulled off the highway, saw his
partner on the far side of the road, sitting on his bike, helmet off, punching
the keypad on his cell phone. He flashed his high beams twice to get the kid's
attention, then rolled around to his side of the road, and pulled up behind
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez slapped his
phone shut, met Tobias halfway between his bike and the cruiser. He opened his
mouth to say something, but Tobias started talking first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We got a break,
won't need to locate the Desert Tours shop after all, at least not right now.
Just as I was passing the Baker exit, I saw one of their vans merging onto the
freeway. I followed it east. It exited about eight miles up on Halloran Springs
Road. It headed toward the hills. Bad news is that it's not paved all the way.
The asphalt turns to dirt after about a mile, then the road disappears around a
hill.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez smiled.
&quot;Looks like we both caught breaks, boss. Did just what you said: scooted
my way up Baker Road and focused on that side of town first. Right at the end
of the road, just before a little bedroom community, is a small shop. One of
their vans is parked right outside. I've got the plate number in here.&quot; He
pointed to his head, then looked at his bike and said, &quot;So what do you
want to do with the bike? It's not going up any gravel roads.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Get back on the
highway. Halloran is the next exit. Take a right. I think there's a place we
can put it where it'll be safe while we go see what's up in the hills.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked at the
cruiser. It was low to the ground with fat tires all around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You sure that
thing's gonna make it? I've been out on these desert roads before. The sand can
get a little deep in places, and sometimes the scrub grows out of the middle
just enough to make them almost impassable to low-clearance vehicles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'm sure we'll be
fine. They're running customers up and down that road every day, so I'd bet my
next two paychecks they're maintaining it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Your call,
boss.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't worry about
it. I saw the van. It's nothing spectacular, not even four-wheel drive. If it
can make it, the cruiser can make it too. Head out. I'll be right behind
you.&quot; Sanchez turned, took three steps toward his bike before Tobias
called him back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Wait!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just one more
thing, boss?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Something like
that. What was the plate number?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez rattled off the
information, then turned back toward his bike. As his partner sped off toward
the highway, Tobias returned to his cruiser. He took out his PDA, entered some
notes regarding the suspected locations of both the facility and the Desert
Tours operation, added the license plate number Sanchez provided, then saved
and emailed the notes to Michaels, hoping he'd consider the information as
grounds for a warrant. He knew it still wasn't enough, though. Not nearly. He
put his PDA away, started his vehicle, and headed out to the highway to follow
his partner. As he drove, he felt his pulse racing, felt his breathing become more
shallow. He felt like a race horse pressing against the gate, ready to run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The morning began with
impeccable timing. Rick rolled up Fifth Street toward Longfellow Elementary,
found his asset walking alone on the sidewalk, lagging behind the other
students, head down, only occasionally lifting her gaze to greet a cat in a
window or a Magpie hopping around on a neighborhood lawn. It was what he
expected to see. It was all a part of her profile. He hadn't written it up,
didn't know who had. It didn't really matter to him, so long as it was
accurate. And it was. Right down to what she was wearing, the nature of her
gait, her approximate height and weight, her skin tone, the length of her hair,
how she wore it, and her social predilections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In his experience, most
profiles took about a week to complete. They had to be thorough, required data
collection that would rival a freaking psychological study. The organization
required it. And he agreed with it, for the most part, even though he though
the whole process was a major pain in the ass. But the information contained in
the completed profiles brought them safety, loads of it. And it's always better
to be safe than behind bars in some federal pen somewhere. Individual profiles
were always preceded by a week of random observation of potential assets, most
of which were weeded out for various reasons, the most important of which were
social behavior and perceived strength of personality. Just like in nature:
stay away from the strong ones, feed on the weak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He pulled up just
behind her, reached over the passenger seat, and opened the door. He yelled out
a neutral greeting, something generic, garbled just enough to confuse the sound
of his voice. She turned, recognized the car. To her, it <i>was</i> her
parents' car: same make, same color. It didn't matter that the wheels were
different, and that it had a spoiler on the back, something conspicuously
absent from her parents' car. It was just similar enough to elicit an instant
recognition mixed with more than a little giddy surprise. To her, the vehicle
was right, which mollified any recognition problems on the part of the
questionable salutation. It was her dad, right? So she ran to the car, jumped
in, and closed the door. By the time she turned to greet her father, Rick had
the sponge ready, freshly saturated with a small amount of chloroform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When she turned, he
grabbed her, placed his hand over her mouth so her screams couldn't be heard.
Her breathing and heartbeat immediately picked up, both of which were ideal
conditions for absorption of the chloroform gas. Rick drew her close,
pantomiming a bear hug, but kept her just far enough away so there was no
danger of the sponge coming into contact with her skin. The trick is to let the
chloroform evaporate and soak the surrounding air, so the gas can be breathed
in. The application has to be just right, though, especially with children.
Smaller bodies have trouble metabolizing the chemical, and overexposure can
cause facial burns, severe headache, and vomiting. She breathed the gas in
through her nose with heavy, excitable gasps. In four breaths, he felt her go
limp in his arms. She'd become groggy, but she wasn't yet out. But she was
close enough to where he felt confident he could remove the sponge, so threw it
out the driver's-side window, then held her close until she succumbed. To
potential passers-by, he would have been seen as a daddy showing affection for
his daughter. The most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>His exit out of Riverside
and his trip up the 215 to the mall in Victorville was uneventful. He parked
the car next to the van, the vehicle Jason was supposed to use for the
hand-off. It was  large, non-descript, and white. It was in good repair, had no
external markings, and was equipped with a mattress in the back, complete with
hand and leg restraints. In his experience, he'd never had to use them, had
never seen anyone, child or adult, come out of chloroform-induced
unconsciousness in less than two hours. And even if they had, they'd be in no
condition to do anything but stay as still as possible in fear of exacerbating
the grinding headache that came upon waking. Rick waited for a lull in
pedestrian traffic, removed the girl from the car, and gently placed her on the
mattress in the back of the van. He then locked it, drove the stolen car to a
full-service car wash about a block away, and paid the attendant eighty dollars
for a wash and detail. Then he just walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Less than an hour
later, he was nearing his destination. He smiled to himself as drove past
Baker. The whole operation had gone more smoothly than he could've possibly
imagined, definitely a whole lot more smoothly than if he'd still been working
with Jason the intellectually-challenged wonder fuck. As he rolled along the
last mile of the 15 and prepared to  take the Halloran exit, he allowed himself
to relax, allowed himself to think about the large sum of money coming his way.
He could smell it. He could finally visualize his dream of starting a new life.
As he headed east on Halloran, though, his visualization suddenly went south,
his dream of a new life began to crumble right in front of him. Just about a
mile ahead of him, heading up the dirt road to the boss's spread, was a
tan-colored sedan. It was too far away to make a specific judgment regarding
its purpose, but he figured that didn't much matter. It definitely didn't
belong to anyone at the ranch, and it wasn't a part of their motor pool.
Whoever the car belonged to, its passengers couldn't be allowed onto facility
grounds under any circumstance. Rick slowed, kept out of site, then reached for
his cell phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The desert has a
definite taste, but it's nothing like chicken. Well, maybe really dry chicken.
Maybe freeze-dried chicken that's had all of its favor-giving fat removed.
Clark lay on his belly, contemplating the culinary classification of the dirt
and organic material sticking to the insides of his mouth. The first part of
his approach was easy. For the first two miles, he could walk, his body secured
from view by the stubby hills bursting out of the desert floor here and there.
As he got close, though, he had to reduce his profile, first by crouching, then
by crawling on his gut. The landscape had proved to be a fickle ally, sometimes
giving him cover to move ten or eleven feet on his hand and knees, other times
providing no cover at all. He was experiencing one of those times now. He'd
done his best to blend in, rolling into the desert floor, pressing the sand and
the dirt and the organic material into his clothing, his hair, his skin, and,
unfortunately, his mouth. The flavor definitely reminded him of something; he
just wasn't sure what.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He crawled on his belly
the remaining distance to a tree bordering the access road, positioned himself
behind it, then scanned both directions. The road was clear, save for a jet
black cattle guard that spanned its width about ten feet to his right. He was
exactly where he wanted to be: at the midpoint of the road's second segment,
fifty yards in either direction from the right angle turns that were engineered
into the road when it was built, probably as a security measure. The position
gave him a perfect place to rest up as he could hear traffic from behind,
ahead, to his left, and to his right. It was the focal point of the road, its
center of gravity. The best defensive position along its entire length.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was hot and tired.
He figured he'd walked about seventy percent of the distance he'd come,
splitting the remaining thirty percent between moving on his hands and knees
and crawling on his stomach. That meant he'd probably crawled on his belly for
just under half a mile. The sun was well into its morning ascent, blasting the
desert with oppressive heat that would only get worse as the afternoon
approached. He positioned himself in a shady spot, broken here and there by
sunlight, but it did little to cool him off. He rolled over, unscrewed the top
of his canteen, took a sip of water to wash the dirt from his mouth, then another
to quench his growing thirst. As he took a second swig, he heard the
distinctive sound of rubber on gravel. It was coming toward him, from his left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He quickly flipped over
onto his belly, hugged the ground, and cocked his head up so he was looking
directly at the access road. He couldn't see the car, but from the sound, he
figured it was only a couple hundred feet away, moving at about ten  miles per
hour. He did a quick calculation, determined he had between ten to fifteen
seconds until the vehicle passed. He pulled the Vinny up tight against the
right side of his body, then looked straight ahead. That's when he noticed two
things simultaneously: the car was a tan-colored Crown Vic, and the jet black
cattle guard he'd seen earlier had disappeared. The car was maybe twenty feet
to his left,  the gaping hole in the road ten feet to his right. No way the car
could stop in time. And it didn't. It rolled right in, its two passengers
shifting violently forward as the vehicle pitched in and came to a sudden,
crunching stop. That's when he heard the second vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was coming from the
left, too. A white van, approaching at a high rate of speed. It moved in on the
crippled Vic like a predator, suddenly stopping when it got to within ten feet
of its rear end. It was just to his left. One driver. Male. There were two
people in the Vic. Both were working to extricate themselves from the air bags
that had pushed into their bodies upon impact with the pit in the road. He
could only see the  passenger, a young Hispanic man. The rear of the car was
about two feet off the ground, its wheels still spinning, grabbing at air. He
couldn't see the license plate, the angle just wasn't there, but he could tell
right away it was a police-issue cruiser, the passengers cops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The driver exited the
van, cautiously made his way toward the space left between his vehicle and the
rear of the cruiser. He was holding a gun in his right hand,  a large caliber
semi-automatic. About the time he reached the front of his van, the doors on
both sides of the Vic opened and both officers climbed onto the road on either
side of the car. They appeared disoriented from the crash, dazed. The guy from
the van raised his gun, pointed it at the Hispanic officer, who gave his
partner a surprised look. The older officer said nothing, just nodded to the
younger man, then both officers raised their hands slowly. That's when he heard
the shot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was fired from
behind him, from a few miles away. The sound startled all three of the men in
front of him, set into motion a deadly and irretrievable chain of events. The
older officer seemed the least affected by the sound. He jumped just a little,
then threw down his hands and took cover behind the left front quarter-panel of
his vehicle. The Hispanic officer, on the other hand, panicked. He went for his
gun. And that's the last thing he ever did. The driver from the van
straightened his arm, cocked his head just a little, then squeezed his trigger.
Less than a hundredth of a second later, the entire right side of the Hispanic
officer's head was blown off, his face ripped to shreds by the searing heat and
piercing violence of a large-caliber bullet. A half a second after later, he
was nothing more than a dead, crumpled heap of human flesh and bone, reposing on
the dry desert floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The driver from the van
kept his arm outstretched, swung his gun toward the position of the older cop,
who was still crouched behind his vehicle, out of view. Clark had used the
unfolding confusion in front of him to move into a crouching position behind the
tree. As man moved in on the cruiser, he lifted the Vinny, flipped the firing
selector to single, then slowly raised the muzzle, placing the crosshairs of
the scope right on the back of the man's head. He breathed in, then slowly
exhaled all of the air from his lungs. Then he gave the trigger a slow, careful
squeeze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He didn't hear the shot
over the whine of the cruiser's spinning wheels, but the scope told him the
small-caliber bullet had definitely left the barrel, gave him a detailed view
of what a nine millimeter lead rocket can do to a skull when fired at close
range. The bullet left the barrel with nothing more than a slight pop, a
whisper. A split second later, it collided with the back of the man's head,
just below where the skull meets the brainstem. It traveled through brain
tissue, then skull again as it exploded out of the center of the man's
forehead, saturating the air around it with a pinkish-gray vapor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before the man's body
hit the ground, Clark was back behind the tree, leaning against it. He fumbled
the selector switch on his rifle, set it to auto. Behind him were two vehicles,
two dead bodies, and one live cop. He looked to his left, to his right, and
directly in front of him, moving the muzzle of the Vinny in the direction of
his shifting scrutiny. Nobody around. He got to his feet, used the massive
trunk of the cottonwood for cover. He looked around the tree, couldn't see the
older officer. He crouched and slowly moved toward the road, muzzle leading the
way. He covered the distance to the cruiser on his hands and knees, keeping his
body behind the right, rear of the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He had the older cop
pinned, and they both knew it. There was no way the officer could put himself
in a position to fire without getting his head blown off. He continued toward
the passenger side of the vehicle, passed the body of the man he'd just shot,
instinctively knocked the handgun away from his lifeless hand as he passed.
When he reached the open passenger door, he raised up just enough to get a
clear view of the Vic's interior. He found what he was looking for. In one
smooth motion, he raised his rifle, leveled it, then squeezed the trigger long
enough to fire three quick shots.</p>
