line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The scrutiny of the
physical evidence was complete. Even with a pending re-test of some of the
material at headquarters, there was a resigned collective acknowledgement that
its quantity and quality lacked sufficient measure to lead to anything
conclusive about Hassenback's assailant. As a shift in strategy hung in the
air, Tobias, Sanchez, Jacobsen, and Kabinski stepped away for coffee and to
answer one of the few calls of nature that just can't be ignored. Rathman
turned away from the camera mounted on his computer, made a non-verbal
production of having other things to do, and then set about making himself look
busy. It was 1:20 in the afternoon. Ten minutes later, everyone was once again
seated around the conference table ready to begin. This time, Kabinski took the
lead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, let's do a
little rehashing. What do we actually know about the assailant? What can we be
certain of?" He said gently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias was perplexed by
Kabinski. The man didn't fit his preconceived notion of what he thought a
psychologist should look like; in other words, he looked nothing like the
legendary Dr. Freud. Instead of a short, crusty old German man sporting a
rumpled beard and wrinkled clothes, Kabinski looked like a cover model for one
of those magazines targeting preppy, metro sexual males. He couldn't have been
anywhere near forty. He had short, blonde hair, green eyes, and a square jaw
framing the bottom of a rough but handsome face. He wore a pair of grey Khakis
decorated with a thin, brown belt, and a white shirt striped in light blue. An
expensive pair of Doc Martins adorned his feet, sans socks. He was the only
person in the room who didn't wear a tie. He exuded relaxation, both mentally
and physically. Tobias considered his question, which was couched in a voice
conflicted with the playboy look he presented. Life is full of paradoxes and
inconsistencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We know the assailant
is probably between six foot two and six foot five, weighs anywhere between 220
and 240 pounds, handy with computers and computer hardware ..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski motioned his
head to an adjacent wall, giving Tobias a non-verbal queue to take the floor
and itemize his descriptions on one of the room's two white boards. Tobias
understood, got up from his chair, walked to the nearest board, picked up a
marker, and bulleted the three points of certain knowledge he'd just
communicated. Then he continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Further," Tobias said,
"we can surmise the assailant or someone close to him has, or had, a child who
was impacted in some way by sexual violence. Given the nature of the crime,
however, I think it's probably safe to say the child was his and is probably
deceased."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Your hypothesis
doesn't go without considerable academic support,&quot; chimed in Rathman.
"While murder resulting from vigilantism is not a big problem in the states, it
still happens. Further, these types of crimes against sexual offenders are much
less likely to occur in cases in which the victim of sexual violence survives.
While the data does agree with your conclusion, however, its associated
probability does not warrant its placement in this list."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski said, "I agree
with Agent Rathman's assessment here, Tobias. Let's leave this off the board
for now and continue with what we know for sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias turned to face
the room, then said, "the rest is academic. From the condition of the crime
scene and the absence of useful physical evidence, we can infer the assailant
is smart careful, and motivated. And that's about it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"We can assume one more
thing," added Kabinski.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yes, we can," added
Rathman, not about to be left out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?" Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"When considering
domestic demographics by race, non-whites have the largest proportion of sexual
crimes committed against their children. But when we talk about sheer numbers,
it's no contest. When we look at the numbers, the victim is almost always
white." Kabinski finished, laced his fingers on the table in front of him, his
dark brown tan almost blending into its surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, so we can safely
assume the assailant is white," Tobias stated. He turned, added to growing list
on the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Most likely," acknowledged
Rathman. "And that wraps up assumptions we can be  confident about. Anything
else we come up with from this point forward will be speculation grounded with
much less certainty."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jacobsen leaned forward
to ensure his voice dominated the background noise collected in the mic in
front of him, then said, "In summary, then, we're certain we're looking for a
white male, between six foot two and six foot five, weighing between 220 and
240 pounds. Further, the assailant knows his way around computer equipment, and
he probably has above average intelligence."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias smiled, pointed
his index finger at Jacobsen, and said, "Okay, I'll send out the all-points!
With that kind of information, we should have this all wrapped up before
morning. Good work, boys!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez chuckled, but
the rest of the room looked more or less impatient. So much for a little ad hoc
humor. Tobias uncapped his pen, turned back to the board, and drew a horizontal
line above his list and wrote <i>What We Know</i> above it. He followed that
with another horizontal line and the text <i>What We Think We Know</i> just to
the right. He then turned to face the room again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay guys, my partner
and I have been thinking about this for the past few days. I admit we didn't
come up with the race angle, but that's part of why we're here, right? I do
believe, however, we've put enough hours into this case to fill in some of the
blanks under our new heading, which might give us a little more to work with.
If you disagree with any of what I am about to say, stop me, and we can
discuss."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Please continue. I'm
very interested in hearing what you've come up with,&quot; said Kabinski. He
leaned forward, both elbows on the table, green eyes focused on Tobias as if he
were the only person in the room. Jacobsen sat at the end of the table,
interested but not in a position to contribute. Rathman fiddled with his tie,
repositioned himself in his seat, and did his best to look aloof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"First, I don't believe
for a second we're looking for a third-party vigilante out to avenge a family
he knows. I've been a cop for a long time, and I may not know the exact
numbers, but I would bet my last paycheck vigilantism of that sort is rare. Not
enough stake in the victim. With that in mind, here's who I think he is."
Tobias went to the board and wrote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>A father of a victim
of sexual violence</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias continued, "I
don't think we can assume anything else here. Nothing else really makes sense.
You can love your niece to death, you can love your god daughter, but you're
not going to engage in this type of behavior to avenge the death of a child
who's not yours. So let's assume the assailant is the father of a child
murdered in the commission of a sex act. What of it? Well, we're in America,
right? If you have one kid, then you probably have 2.4. Acting out in this way
is very risky, could take you out of the lives of your remaining children, not
to mention your wife. My bet is that under almost every circumstance a father
with a remainder household is going to choose to take care of business at home
rather than launch a vigilante mission fraught with danger and a low
probability of success." Tobias returned to the board. This time he wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>The victim was an only
child</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Now let's return to
the crime scene for a moment. The plate glass was knocked out of the window of
the door at the back of the Hassenback residence. The assailant entered the home
there and then lay in wait until Hassenback returned home. The guy knew where
Hassenback lived, he knew what day to lay in wait, and he seems to have known
about what time Hassenback would be home. This tells me the assailant watched
the victim, long enough to catch on to his day-to-day patterns. All of us in
here know this could take weeks, if not longer.&quot; Again Tobias wrote on the
board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>He conducted surveillance</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I'd wager he spent a
few weeks watching Hassenback." Tobias let that float out into the air, allowed
it to be breathed in by the others in the room. Then he continued. "That takes
preparation. And lots of patience. It takes dedication, as proper surveillance
has to be done at all hours of the day and night. It interferes with the rest
of your life. Ask any cop's wife about it: surveillance is incompatible with
harmonious matrimony." Tobias went to the board one more time, and wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>He is alone in the
world</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias capped his
marker, returned it to the white board, then took his seat at the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kabinski leaned back in
his chair, laced his fingers together to support the back of his head and
considered what Tobias had written. After a moment, he brought his arms down to
his sides, looked at Tobias, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Pretty well
considered, detective. And I really don't have a problem with any of it. I
think you're right, most acts of vigilantism by mainstream middle class people
are kept in check by the nest.&quot; He motioned to the board with his head,
said, &quot;No reason to sit now. You seem to have a lot of this figured out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thought I would give
you guys an opportunity to contribute," Tobias replied, a grin forming at the
corners of his mouth, its reflection bouncing out of his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"All pretty obvious."
Quipped Rathman. "Nice guess on the vigilante loner angle, too. I hate to be
the bearer of bad news, but a man with a remainder family is not statistically
less likely to commit a revenge killing than a father who lost everything. You
need to widen your scope a little. But I guess that shows the difference
between Quantico and the Police Academy, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Quit being an ass,
Rathman," Kabinski retorted. "Besides, if you would pay more attention to the
details, you would've realized this wasn't a revenge killing at all." He then
turned to Tobias and said, "Sorry, it would appear Special Agent Rathman is a
little crabby right now and in great need of a nap."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman just stared
blankly through the wall, said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jacobsen appeared to be
looking off into the distance, concentrating on something. A confused look was
painted on his face. "This is <i>n­ot</i> a revenge killing?" He asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No, most likely it's
not," answered Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, I'll bite&quot;,
said Rathman. "Enlighten me."<br>
Sanchez continued, "the scene itself tells us."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What do you mean?"
Demanded Rathman. He turned in his chair, placed a forefinger at the center of
his glasses and pushed them up his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said, "the
house was trashed. Almost all of the storage media was taken. The whole place
underwent a systematic search. If the assailant had been there for a revenge
killing, if he'd actually found the person who'd killed his child, then why
search at all? What's the point?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Perhaps he was looking
for images of his child. Maybe he wanted to destroy them," answered Rathman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez gave Tobias a
look. <i>Deja Vu</i>. Tobias nodded to the kid, let him continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"There wasn't any need
to remove the media from the house. If that's all he was after, he could have
simply destroyed the hard drive and whatever else he found right there. No need
to take it. And besides, what would be the point? Hassenback's dead. No one
left to spread it. Next visit to the house is from us, and all we're going to
do is run it through forensics and eventually destroy it anyway. Further, if
Hassenback actually did have images of the guy's kid, odds are he shared those
with a friend long ago, and that friend passed them on as well, so what good
would it do to destroy the media at all?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're missing
something, Sanchez," replied Rathman. A smile formed on his ruddy face,
appeared to drip with arrogance. "If the assailant left the media at the house
and did not destroy it, we could scrutinize it, perhaps find images of his
child, and that would lead directly to <i>him</i>. See, he's not removing the
media to conduct some amateur investigation; he's not removing the media to
keep more images of his child from spreading around the internet. He's removing
the media to cover his ass. And even if he did try to destroy the media at the
house, you'd be surprised at what modern computer forensics can do with a fried
hard drive. He accomplished what he set out to do by killing Hassenback. The
search was about mitigating any chance of connecting him to the crime. Simple
as that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez blanched, said
nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good point," said
Tobias. &quot;I wish I would've thought of that. But I was all caught up in how
the murder went down and what took place afterward. See, Hassenback was killed
first, and then his assailant spent the next few hours in his house,
systematically searching it for media. We figure he was in there for a good
three or four hours based on its thoroughness. He found the computer
immediately. He took the hard drive out. But he didn't put it in the sink. He
didn't put it in the oven, either. As far as we know he didn't do anything at
all to it. He just put it to the side and spent the next three and a half hours
continuing his search. He must not have been very smart, that guy. Because if
it had been me, and all I was after was the destruction of shots my kid in this
pervert's private stash, I think I would have broiled the drive while I conducted
the rest of my search. Yeah, computer forensics is hot these days, but it would
come up with nothing on a drive that's been broiled in an oven for a couple of
hours. But he didn't do that. He made sure he took the drive with him. It was
an additional risk, taking that thing out of the house, along with whatever
else he found. But why would he take that risk, sir? Unless he wanted something
else from the media? And that's what I thought. See, I figured he took the
hardware because he thought he might find something important on it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rathman laced his tie
around his stubby fingers, then said, &quot;like what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias continued,
&quot;A clue, sir. Something that might lead him to the person who actually did
harm his kid. Because when you get down to it, if Hassenback had been the guy,
then what would be the point of searching the house at all? The assailant
actually seems to be a pretty bright guy. Lots of planning, surveillance, and
no evidence. I wonder what he'd think about the odds of our being able to find
him by scrutinizing the images on the media? Pedophiles have serious stashes.
Which department is going to systematically cross-reference every single one of
them with the recorded victims of sexual crimes, and then research the hits
they get to look for a large, white man? I'm not a believer in that. He killed
Hassenback, he searched the house, and he took the media, all with one goal in
mind: to help him with his own search. It's the only thing that makes sense to
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias leaned back in
his chair, looked around at the others as he let them absorb what he'd said.
Jacobson had a blank look on his face, Kabinski sported a crooked smirk,
Sanchez had an unapologetic shit-eating grin plastered on his face, and Rathman
simply looked defeated. The room remained silent for a moment, then Jacobsen
turned to Tobias, said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I agree with your line
of reasoning, Detective Tobias. It seems more probable than taking the hardware
to simply destroy evidence elsewhere. Could you write that up on the board?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias got up, retrieved
the marker, and wrote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Not a revenge
killing. Serial action to collect information.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jacobsen looked around,
said "Okay, let's take a break for dinner. None of us have eaten all day. Given
what we've come up with so far, though, I think we should get back at this
tonight, while the iron is hot. Personally," he looked directly at Tobias, "I
think we've made quite a bit of headway."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez got
up from their seats, walked out of the conference room, entered the elevator,
and took it to the lobby of the new LAPD building. As they headed out the big
glass doors of the facility, Sanchez broke the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Whaddya think, boss?"
He asked, a smile beginning to peal around the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I agree with Jacobsen.
I think we've made some headway. And what are you smiling about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"The way you handed
Rathman's ass to him on a platter." Sanchez let out a chuckle and continued,
"Honestly, boss, I thought he had a good point. Then you go all Zeus and
thunderbolts on him, like he's some kind of kid needing a good lecture. It was
great!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I think he means well,
Sanchez," Tobias lied. "A couple of decades in this business can give a guy
insight. That's all it is."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay. If you say so.
Where're we going to eat? I'm starving."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, they're probably
expecting us back in an hour, so it's going to have to be someplace quick. I
saw a Chinese place down the road on the way in. You up for some of that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. Sure. I just
need to eat. I was about to die in there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Me too. Let's go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri Parker
flipped through the pages of material her friend Lisa had left with her. The
amount of information was immense, almost overwhelming; the content was
striking. There was a definite conclusion she could leverage in the story she
was beginning to formulate: children are under-served in the medical industry.
In fact, children are more like a subclass of people afforded only grudging
support, and for some unknown and tragic reason, it appeared that children with
cancer had the least support of all. It seemed to her the reality of the system
was just the opposite of what it should be. As she began re-reading what she
had highlighted the night before, her phone rang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She shifted the
material from her lap to her new coffee table, which she had recently picked up
from one of those discount furniture markets. The table had an aluminum body,
painted black, and its top was constructed from several rectangular stone
segments of various sizes.  When buying furniture, Carri followed two
self-imposed rules: it had to be inexpensive, and it had to roughly agree in
style with the other, mostly-used furniture she had collected over the years.
Some of her furniture was modern, some rustic, but together it presented a
warm, country feel, a reactionary theme purposefully set against the hustle and
bustle of the city in which she worked. She got up from her soft, burgundy
couch, tramped barefoot to her kitchen, grabbed the phone from her purse, and
answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This is Carri."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri waited, her ear
pressed to the phone, the sound of her heart beginning to assert itself as the
loudest noise in the room. She heard some rustling in the background, wondered
if it was Chuck, wondered if he had once again bullied her number out of one of
her friends. She hoped not, but given the continuing silence, who else could it
be? The jackass was apparently playing one of his stupid, childish mind games,
doing whatever he could to make her life miserable. Anger and resentment welled
up within her, trumped the fear that generally plagued her when confronting
him. She felt blood rush to her face and her pulse quicken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look, asshole, you
know this is a violation of your restraining order, and so was that shit you
pulled the other day. You're lucky I didn't call the cops on you. I should
have.&quot; She paused for a reaction. When she got none, she continued,
&quot;you know what? I'm going to call them right now, so fuck off, Chuck!"
Carri started to move the phone away from her ear and slap it shut, when she
heard a tinny, distant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wait!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri returned the
phone to her ear. Not Chuck. Shit. What if it was a business call? The anger
and resentment she'd been feeling were quickly replaced by a wave of
embarrassment and nausea. How could something like this even happen? Chuck. He
was making her life miserable, almost non-functional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You okay?" The voice
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Recognition swept over
her. She smiled to herself. She'd wondered if he would call, thought he
probably wouldn't. Over the past few days, she kept returning to those eyes,
quietly contemplating what had been behind them. She remembered how fierce they
looked when she first saw him, how they remained that way when he was dealing
with Chuck, and how, when he'd talked to her outside the bar, they had transitioned
from icy cold to nearly warm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Joe! Oh my God, I'm so
sorry. I thought you were Chuck.&quot; She paused for a moment, then said,
&quot;I honestly didn't think you'd call. How are you?" She immediately felt a
little embarrassed for asking such a stupid question. She didn't even know the
guy. <i>How are you</i>? Compared<i> </i>to what?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Good," he replied. 
"Just thought I'd call and check up on you, make sure you're OK."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, I'm fine thanks
to you. I still owe you a drink, you know." It wasn't phrased as a statement but
as an invitation. She hoped she wasn't being too forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was a pause on
the line, then, "You don't owe me anything, Carri. I didn't do anything anyone
else wouldn't do. Besides, what could be better than helping a pretty woman in
a jam?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Flattery will get you

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You never know. I just
happened to be the first guy there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, no matter,&quot;
she replied. "But I still want to buy you a drink. You know, for doing nothing
special in particular."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another pause on the
line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Unfortunately,
I'm going to have to take a rain check, Carri. I'm in the middle of something
right now, and it's really consuming my time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri disassembled the
sentence, started reading between the lines, then caught herself. She
remembered thinking how it appeared something was weighing him down when he was
in the bar, something <i>really</i> heavy. She wondered if her perception of
his state of mind had something to do with whatever was consuming all of his
time. She wanted to find out, but she realized she probably wouldn't get the
chance: it was clear he wanted to get off the phone. But then <i>why</i> did he
call? <i>Just</i> to check up on her? She realized, too, that half of her was
in denial about why she really wanted to see this man again, while the other
half was warning her she was about to tread some uncertain, maybe dangerous,
waters. The briefest of skirmishes ensued, denial won, and she snapped herself
back into the conversation to try one more time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, I believe you're
busy, but I really very much want to show you my appreciation, Joe. Just give
me an hour, okay? We can go get a drink and some appetizers somewhere, I can
get a proper thank you out of the way, and then we can go our own directions.
But I really feel like I need to do this. Please don't make me beg."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another pause, although
this time she thought he might actually be considering her invitation. She
offered a little more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, I'll even make it
someplace close to you so it won't take too long for you to get back to what
you're doing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, but I can only
stay an hour. Is that all right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The short conversation
over, a quick dinner meeting was set for a place far from Clark's pathetic,
temporary hovel on the fringes of LA. He was on the road less than five minutes
after the call. Truth be told, he wanted to see her, but he knew he really
shouldn't risk the exposure. Lay low. Stay out of trouble. He knew the police
had found Hassenback, and they certainly had time to process the scene and
study the body by now. Clark was no expert in forensics, but he was confident
he'd left very little in the way of material evidence behind. In spite of the
probable lack of evidence at the site, however, he figured they had more than
likely come up with some kind of general description of him. He knew he
shouldn't be bothered by that, though; after all, how many people in the LA
area fit his description? But it still made him nervous, and it was better to
simply be careful rather than to take unnecessary risks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the other hand,
he'd been working all day, and he was tired. He felt as though his mind were
swimming through Jell-O. And a beer sounded awfully good. It might even help
him relax a little and allow him to focus when he got back to work. The website
crept back onto the foreground as he drove, pushed aside the idle thoughts. It
was very different from anything else he'd seen before. It was corporate. It
was sophisticated. It was believable. It had to be a gateway for a large,
well-funded organization. He ran its content through his mind, tried to think
of something he missed, but nothing came to him. He knew he would have to gain
access to the site, so the next obvious step would require a quick surveillance
of Hassenback's friend Eduardo, followed by some persuasive conversation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Clark made a
mental list of things to do, he followed the 110 toward Pasadena, exited on
North Avenue, and swung onto West Colorado Boulevard. The place Carri suggested
was called Stoney Point Restaurant. He'd heard of it before but had never been
there. In his former life, his friends had recommended it, telling him it had
an excellent range in cuisine, specializing in French and Italian seafood
dishes. He got lucky, found curb-side parking right out front. He killed his
ignition, stepped out of his truck, stretched, and took a quick look around.
Satisfied the place was anonymous enough, he crossed the sidewalk and walked
into the restaurant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The place was surprisingly
small. Along the left wall, there was a bar and serving station, nothing fancy.
Immediately in front of the bar was a line of stools, which accommodated
several customers, most of whom were probably imbibing in stress-reducing
libation before continuing on their way home. Just to the right of the
barstools were five, small rectangular tables, done up in white cotton table
clothes. White napkins shaped into small pyramids stood atop of leather-bound
placemats that doubled as menus. Just to the right of the tables was a wall,
within which was set a large picture frame window. The place was cozy, to say
the least. Carri sat at the table against the far end of the restaurant,
sipping a glass of red wine. She recognized him, smiled, and waved him over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Thank you for
coming,&quot; she said, still smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri sat comfortably
and confidently in her chair, watching him with sparkling azure eyes as he took
a seat across from her. Clark couldn't help but notice how beautiful she
looked. She had thick black hair that was pinned up to expose a long, slender
neck, which was adorned with a conservative pearl necklace. Her smile revealed
a set of pearly-white teeth, which were in perfect contrast with ruby red lips.
She wore a simple blue and white cotton dress that came down just below her
knee. Her legs were crossed; on her feet she wore simple black flats. She
looked like she stepped right out of the fifties. As much as he didn't want to
admit it, she looked really good. A waitress came by, and he ordered a beer. As
he looked across the table at her, an incongruous thought formulated within his
mind and tapped him on the shoulder. He knew he shouldn't ask, but he did
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So ...&quot; He paused.
&quot;How'd you wind up with a guy like Chuck?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri's brow furrowed a
bit and she frowned. Nope. Not a good question to ask. But, honestly, he really
didn't care. He had a choice: he could stay here for an hour and probably
torture himself with conversation that would be painful and evasive, at least
on his part; or he could come off as an insensitive asshole, bring this whole
thing to an end, and get back to work. She remained quiet for a moment and then
answered the question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Just one mistake in a
long procession of bad decisions." She sighed, her brow relinquishing its
message of moderate resentment in favor of a more playful arch. "You see, I've
always had big problems finding men who're really worth a damn. In fact, I
haven't met one yet!" A slight smile curved at the corners of her mouth. Her
eyes, though, signaled her statement was probably closer to the truth than she
would've liked to admit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sorry you've had so
much trouble," he said. Her eyes softened, but she said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What are you going to
do about him?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I don't know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You know he's
not going to stop, and I'm sure you know how these things turn out, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, I know." A
chilly resignation melted over her voice. She was clearly a little
uncomfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Have you thought about
moving away?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Honestly, Joe, I have.
But I have a good thing here. It's taken me years to build up to where I am now
at the paper. If I left now, it would be like pressing a giant reset button on
my life. I'm not sure I'm willing to do that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Fair enough."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri said
nothing. Clark looked at her. She seemed to be getting a little impatient,
perhaps upset, with his line of questioning. He figured he'd probably be back
on the road in less than five minutes. But he had to get one more thing out,
felt it necessary to motion to the elephant right there in front of both of
them. He knew it, and she more than likely did too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Look, I know you
don't like thinking about things like this. Who does? But if you aren't going
anywhere and he's not going anywhere, then you should think about getting a gun
and learning how to use it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I've considered it. I
just don't like them, Joe." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark felt a
twinge of guilt pass through him. The day he'd helped her, he'd given her that
name in case the police had been called. If they had shown up, a fake name
would've given them just enough motivation to file away the complaint and then
forget about it. There had been no damage, both parties to the disturbance had
fled, and the police had much better things to do than look for a couple of
guys guilty of nothing more than a bar fight. Wrong name, but what to do about
it now, though? It wasn't like he was even remotely thinking of starting
anything with this woman.  A little misinformation couldn't hurt things in that
case, right? Clark remained silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So ... what do you do?"
She asked, like it was a loaded question. Maybe it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This and that," he
answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh, c'mon. You can
give me a little more detail!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark sensed a feigned
playfulness in her admonishment, but he also saw something like recognition
sweep across her face, as if his answer had clarified something for her. Clark
thought about it, then replied,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I work with children."
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri's eyes flew open.
"Really? What a coincidence! I'm doing a story on children right now. Children
and healthcare. In fact, the woman you saw at the bar with me, Lisa, she's my
source. She works at a metro hospital. She gave me some information you would
not believe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark said a silent
prayer of thanks for the coincidence. While it was obvious he failed at his
attempt to make a quick exit, given her enthusiasm about her story, he knew if
he played his cards right he might get away with not having to talk about
himself at all. He put on his most interested face, then said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sounds intriguing.
Tell me about what you're writing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's sad, really. I
don't want to bring you down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh please." He smiled.
"You've piqued my curiosity. If you leave me hanging now, I won't be able to
think of anything else for the rest of the night."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well  okay. It's
about kids with cancer." She frowned. "Did you know almost twelve thousand kids
die from cancer each year?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark shook his head.
Negative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"It's true. And don't
get me wrong, research has progressed tremendously over the past couple of
decades." Carri made an exaggerated wave of her hands as she said the word <i>tremendously</i>.
She continued, "In fact, a couple of decades ago, the survival rate for
pediatric cancer was just ten percent. Now it's around eighty. But there are
still way too many kids dying from it, and the way funding is channeled to
pediatric cancer research and treatment is terrible. Why, it's almost criminal
in my opinion!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri was animated,
pretty, and passionate. She was very articulate. And she believed in what she
was doing, that was clear. He could see the dedication spilling out of her, a
deluge resulting from the hard work and tenacity she put into her vocation. He
thought she probably had worked very hard to get to her current position at the
paper. Why reset that? He made a mental note that he'd need to find Chuck and
have a little talk with him before he left town. Clark simply nodded his head
in agreement, now drawn into the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"So what's screwing up
the funding?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri took a quick sip
of her wine. Clark reciprocated with a sip of beer, which he had been
completely ignoring. She continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, take the
National Cancer Institute, for example. Their budget last year was 4.6 <i>billion</i>
dollars." Again she pantomimed with her hands as if she could use them to make
Clark understand just how much money that was. "Of that money, breast cancer
received twelve percent while prostate cancer received seven. You know how much
all childhood cancers combined got?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark again shook
his head. Negative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Less than three
percent, Joe!" Her eyes opened a little wider, she looked upward, and her voice
cracked just slightly. Clark briefly wondered if this was more than just a
story to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's a crime,"
Clark agreed, meaning it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was drawn in,
found her charm and enthusiasm hard to resist. The rest of the hour was
consumed deep in conversation about pediatric cancer, a blur of animated facts
and stories about what she'd researched, and the children she'd visited. He'd
honestly shared her shock and contempt when she told him that for every one
child diagnosed with AIDS, 15 are diagnosed with cancer; yet the amount spent
on the child with AIDS is fully 30 times more than that spent on the child with
cancer. He'd as well shared her grief when she told him about a particular
little girl she'd visited who had succumbed only a week ago after three
remissions from leukemia. It hit home, just in a slightly different way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While he was now
actually enjoying himself, Clark found it more and more difficult to follow the
remainder of the conversation. His mind kept returning to his work and what he
had to do. He had to admit, though, that some of his attention was drifting in
another direction, going down a path he couldn't let it. There could be no
distractions. Clark found an entry point into the conversation and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You're really
passionate about what you do, and I can't even begin to tell you how much I
enjoyed our conversation. But ..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"But you have to
get back to work," she finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. I really am
sorry." He reached in his back pocket and began taking out his wallet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No!" Carri said,
forcefully. "I asked <i>you</i> out; therefore, I'm going to pay. Okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark considered the
challenge. He was still a little old fashioned and would've rather picked up
the tab. But he had to get back to work, so he decided not to haggle about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay. I'm fine
with that. But you have to let me get the tip." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Carri agreed and
Clark tossed a twenty on the table. Carri retrieved her purse from the floor,
removed her wallet, opened it, and retrieved her credit card. Clark saw it edge
on first. Then, as Carri turned it over to place it flat on the table,
asickening feeling dropped into his stomach like a bomb. His breathing became
jagged, and his face flushed. The website flashed back into his mind. He had
overlooked something, something that could break his search wide open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Are you okay?"
Asked Carri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark did his best
to nod his head and tell her not to worry. He felt dizzy. He put his hands on
the table and pushed himself up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I really have to
go, Carri. Thank you. I had a wonderful time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before she could
reply, Clark had turned and hurried toward the door.</p>
