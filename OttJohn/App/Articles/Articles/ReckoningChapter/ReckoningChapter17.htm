<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark walked
toward his truck, his second-guessing about eliminating Eduardo dissipating
with each step. He hadn't really wanted to kill the man, but it didn't take him
long to realize it was the only thing he could do. He had priceless information
in hand, information he knew would likely allow him to bring closure to the
single most important objective of his life: to exact revenge on the man who'd
destroyed his family. Alive, Eduardo would've presented too many risks,
presented too many unknowns and too many distractions. Eduardo breathing was
simply a luxury he couldn't afford. Not with the end so near, so close.
Eduardo, therefore, had to die, just as Hassenback did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark heard the
sound of a single footfall behind him, a slight scuff on the uneven pavement.
The warning he'd felt earlier in Eduardo's apartment returned, shot through his
body like fire. He slowed but kept his direction, focused on listening to
determine distance and location. The sound came to him over the still morning
air. Soft steps. Slow steps. Careful steps. About ten feet behind him. Then he
heard the voice. It was hushed, barely above a whisper, but laced with
animosity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Well,
whaddya know. If it ain't lover boy from the bar. You know, you should be a
little more careful about where you park, asshole. I mean, what're the odds? Me
just driving by, and there's your truck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark recognized
the voice immediately. It belonged to Carri's ex-husband, Chuck. He figured
after getting his ass kicked in front of her, he was probably still a little
pissed off. But he also figured the guy would be smart enough to avoid him for
fear of another beating. Wrong on one count. Of course, two circumstances could
give Chuck the courage he needed to face him now: he brought a friend or he was
armed. Maybe both. There was only one way to find out. Clark took a single,
deep breath, then slowly turned around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck was alone,
filled with courage borrowed from the rounds punched into the clip of the Colt
45 Automatic he held at the end of his outstretched right arm. Understanding
the odds for what they were, Clark slowly put down his briefcase and bag, then
raised his hands until the tips of his fingers were even with the tops of his
ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Nice gun.
Love the no-slip grip on those things. Could you do me a favor and not point
that at me?&quot; Clark spoke slowly, wondering if Chuck would actually risk
firing the gun in a congested area full of potential witnesses. Sleeping or
not, a round fired from a 45 in the early morning hours would certainly wake up
a lot of people, definitely enough to provide a reliable description of the
moron who was now standing in front of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck just leered
at him. &quot;No way, asshole. I'm not stupid. Now pick up your shit; we're
going for a ride.&quot; He motioned with his free hand at the briefcase and
plastic bag at Clark's feet, the lit end of his cigarette creating a fiery
zigzag in the air in front of him as he did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark didn't move,
simply stared at Chuck. He was a big guy, probably had quite a bit of stamina.
But an outstretched arm wasn't meant to hold onto a three pound weight for an
extended amount of time. If he could stall for even a few minutes, Chuck would
have no choice but to lower his weapon, which might shift the odds his way,
even if just a little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, you
hold all the cards, boss. But you need to know the thing in the bar was just a
misunderstanding, a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot;
Clark kept his hands up, continued with the slow, soft tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck said
nothing. Clark gave him his best concerned look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You don't
want to do this, man. Think about it. You have your whole life in front of you.
You're gonna get caught, and then you're gonna spend the rest of your days in
prison, or worse. It's just not worth it. Just put the gun down. I'll walk my
way, you'll walk yours, and we'll forget this ever happened. Promise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck's facial
expression slackened a bit. For a moment, he seemed to be considering what
Clark had said. Then something flashed in his demeanor, an emotional hollowness
tinged with a giddy anger. The face of a sociopath caught up in the ecstasy of
feeling real emotion. And power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fuck you.
There ain't nothing you gonna say that's gonna make me change my mind. But it
might be fun to watch you grovel before I splatter your brains all over the
place. Maybe I'll make you beg for your life, too. If you're lucky.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark understood
Chuck's reaction for what it was, pulled the sensibility card. He'd get nowhere
with that. There's no talking sense into a sociopath. He'd have to take another
route, a much more dangerous one, but one that might just buy him the time he
needed. He motioned with his head to the cigarette slowly burning to a stub in
Chuck's right hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Mind if I
bum one of those?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why? You and
my wife share one of 'em after she spread her slutty legs for you? I bet that's
what you want to be thinking about when the back of your head gets blown off,
isn't it? The both of you lying there in bed, passing a smoke back and forth
after you've done your dirty business. Well, fuck you! You ain't gettin'
shit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Adding accelerant
to a fire can be a dangerous thing. You have to pick the right one to make the
fire bend to your will. Clark needed Chuck's to smolder for a while, choke him
with heavy smoke before erupting into a consuming conflagration. He thought
about what he was going to say, hoping it would be more like adding an armload
of dry leaves to a open flame, rather than a gallon of gasoline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll trade
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Trade me
what, bitch? I don't want nothing but your stinking, rotting corpse on the
ground in front of me. What the hell do you have to trade?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I can tell
you the truth about Carri. You're right about her. Don't you want to know what
we did? Don't you want to hear about the thing's she's done to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man's reaction
changed quickly, transformed from a giddy rage to the look of an addict about
to get another needle full of heroine. The expression lasted for only a moment,
then reverted back to its former complexion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fuck
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>More fuel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You don't
want to know? To be honest, I don't want to be the only person who gets fucked
over by what she did. Hell, I even have other names for you if you want
them.&quot; Clark paused for effect. &quot;Lots of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The junkie was
back. It was as easy as flipping a light switch. Right fuel. Clark hoped he'd
get the right outcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fucking
bitch!&quot; Chuck said it mostly under his breath, basically spat it out
between grinding teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Give me the
smoke, Chuck. I need one if I'm gonna tell you everything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fuck it. Who
am I to deny a man his last smoke?&quot; Chuck reached in his shirt pocket with
his left hand, removed his pack, and tossed it to Clark, who caught with his
right hand. Clark took out a cigarette, removed the lighter from the plastic
lining of the pack, and lit up. It had been years since he'd last smoked. As he
inhaled, he could feel the nicotine pour into his body, course through his
veins like a heavy poison. He had to focus not to cough. He put the lighter
back in the plastic lining and started to toss the pack back to Chuck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Stop! No way
I'm falling for that, asshole! You think I'm stupid? Just throw them on the
ground.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark did what
Chuck asked, threw the pack to the side. He took another deep drag from his
cigarette and exhaled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You just
gonna sit there looking like a fucking idiot, or are you going to tell me what
the fucking bitch did to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Where do you
want me to start?&quot; Clark took another deep drag, exhaled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't fuck
with me. Just tell me what you two did. All the sleazy details so I can go
shove that up her ass after I'm done here with you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay.&quot;
Clark lowered his hands, placed them at his sides. &quot;We met at some dive
bar. Can't remember the name of it. She was sitting alone on a stool, wearing
one of those really tight miniskirts, legs crossed, almost falling out of a
pink tank top. I couldn't help myself. I walked up. I didn't need to say
anything. She just asked if I wanted a good time, said she had some coke,
wanted to get high ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So she's not
just a fucking whore, she a fucking <i>coke</i> whore?&quot; Chuck sounded
incredulous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. She
did a line in the bathroom before we left. Invited me in, but the bar was
starting to get busy, so I didn't risk it. I waited ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just get to
the fucking details, fuckhead. I don't need the scenery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark remained
cool but knew he had to resolve this quickly: the sky to the east was turning
pink, which would soon be followed by a bright morning sun. He needed the cover
of darkness, couldn't risk a witnesses. His cigarette had burned most of the
way down. A couple of more drags and he'd have it just about where he'd need
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We came back
here to my place.&quot; Clark motioned with his head toward Eduardo's
apartment. He took one more drag of his cigarette, then lowered it to his side,
rolling it between his thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;She did you
up there, didn't she?&quot; Chuck rotated his head slightly, taking in the
apartment complex. &quot;Just goes to show, a slut'll fuck anyone, anywhere.
Now tell me what you and the bitch did. Consider it your last confession.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck erupted with
a short, hysterical laugh, his face etched with a perverse satisfaction. He was
nothing more than a junky greedily taking a hit, feeding off the emotion
running through his body. Instead of elaborating, Clark just stood there and
said nothing, watched the man simmer impatiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Tell me what
you and the whore did, asshole! I wanna whisper it in her ear while she's
dying, watch the life run out of her while I'm telling her she's nothing but a
dirty fucking slut.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Chuck,
that's private, man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chuck keeled back
slightly in disbelief, dumbstruck at Clark's flat response. The complexion in
his face changed to the nervous look of an addict who'd lost his needle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Fuck you!
You fucked her, and now you're fucked!&quot; He tightened his grip on the Colt,
lowered it so it was pointing right at Clark's groin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No, Chuck. I
just told you what you wanted to hear.&quot; Clark was sure Chuck's
self-control was beyond the man's reach, inextricably lodged somewhere between
anger and anticipation. Not good. Pushed the odds of the moron firing his
weapon to likely. Which meant he needed to end this quickly. And Chuck was just
about where he needed him to be to do that. He smiled, risked a laugh of his
own, then said, &quot;She's not a bad person, Chuck. You are. You're the
fuck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You think
you're pretty smart, don't you, big man? I wonder how smart you're gonna feel
with a big fucking hole in your head! Fuck this. Get your shit. We're going for
a ride. One way trip for you, though, asshole.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark noticed the
gun was beginning to quake, a result of fatigue, confusion, and a copious
amount of adrenaline. He said nothing, just locked eyes with the man and
visualized what he needed to do. As he rolled his cigarette until it was
pinched between the pad of his thumb and the nail of his forefinger, Chuck
slowly elevated his gun for a head shot, the muzzle tracing out tiny circles in
front of him. No more time. Clark exhaled, then flicked his cigarette toward
Chuck's face. Just by dumb luck, the butt connected with the man's left eye. He
would've been happy with a neck shot or even a shot to the cheek; either way,
the reaction was unavoidable: Chuck instinctively lowered his head and thrust
his hands to his face. Clark quickly closed the distance between them, grabbed
the gun with his left hand and delivered a vicious uppercut to the bottom of
Chuck's chin with his right. The momentum of the blow sent Chuck's head
skyward. Clark met it on its way up with a crushing head-butt, ripped the gun
away, and grabbed Chuck's throat and squeezed it until he was sure he'd crushed
his airway. He could feel his fingernails dig into the man's neck, could feel
blood erupting around his digits and trickling up his wrist. Chuck's legs
buckled, and Clark eased him to the ground, looking into his bulging eyes as he
did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Never give
your opponent a weapon, asshole.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark checked the
gun, switched on the safety, and stowed it in the beltline in the small of his
back. Then he assessed his surroundings: Chuck's crumpled body was about ten
feet away from the right rear bumper of his truck, sprawled on the asphalt,
convulsing in a futile attempt to take in oxygen. A few lights had come on in
some of the apartments in the complex, early morning risers preparing for
another day of work. Daylight was coming. He had a dilemma, figured he probably
had about ten minutes to decide what to do about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He couldn't leave
Chuck's body where it lay. And there was no obvious place to hide it. He
thought briefly about lugging it up to Eduardo's apartment, but he didn't want
to risk a commotion, wasn't even sure if he had the energy for that anyway. He
couldn't put him in his truck, either. It was cluttered, full of possessions he
used for day-to-day living. If he had the time, he could clear it out, but the
whole process would take him at least a half hour, which was probably 20
minutes more than he could spare. Under the circumstances, there was really
only one option: he'd have to find Chuck's car, conceal the body there, drive
it somewhere remote, dump the body, and return to the apartment complex later
in the day to swap vehicles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It took about a
minute for Clark to drag Chuck's body so it was hidden in the shadows beneath
the bumper of his truck. It took less than a minute to find the keys to Chuck's
car and another two frantic minutes to locate the vehicle itself. Clark
unlocked it, started it, and drove it back to his truck, parking the car so the
vehicles were almost bumper-to-bumper, the trunk of the car about three feet
from the bed of his truck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Lifting a body is
awkward, even to the relatively low height presented by the trunk of Chuck's
Mustang. Clark figured it was roughly two and a half feet. It'd been some time
since he'd lifted anything of considerable weight from the ground to that
height. He briefly wished rigor was something that set in a matter of minutes
rather than hours. Lifting a dead weight is difficult enough; lifting a weight
that can unexpectedly rotate or shift is something else entirely. Clark
squatted at the direct center of the body, used his right arm to move Chuck's
leg so his knee bent off from the ground. Clamping the base of the man's skull
with his left hand and hooking his right forearm under the crook of the man's
right knee, he carefully hefted Chuck's body off the ground and threw him into
the trunk of the car and closed the lid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He collected his
briefcase and the plastic bag containing the items he'd confiscated from
Eduardo's apartment, placed both on the driver's side floor board of the
Mustang. He then returned to his truck, retrieved what little he kept that
could identify him, his toolbox, his pay-as-you-go phone, and placed those in
the back seat of the car. As he walked to the driver's side door of the
Mustang, he took one last quick look around to ensure he'd cleaned the area
sufficiently. The lot basically looked as it had when he'd walked across it a
few hours before. He climbed into the car, fired it up, and drove out of the
parking lot. He figured transferring his possessions would likely turn out to
be unnecessary, but he didn't want to risk leaving anything that could be
connected to him in a truck that could be vandalized, towed, or even discovered
by the police. As he pulled out of the lot, he peered into the rearview mirror,
saw the first of the early-morning risers making his way to a vehicle. He'd
just made it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The staccato bursts of
gunfire reverberated in Tobias's ears, emanating from a single gunman several
yards away. The combination of adrenaline and a hyper awareness amplified the
sound just enough to cause a persistent ringing in his ears. He was behind his
cruiser, squatting next to the front, driver's-side wheel well for protection.
The gunman in front of him was walking slowly toward him, wearing full body
armor, brandishing an older model, Russian-made, AK-47. The man let go with another
controlled burst of three quick shots: <i>pop-pop-pop!</i> Tobias felt the air
around him stir slightly as one bullet slammed into the body of his cruiser and
another ricocheted off the asphalt and careened by him. He was basically
trapped. The only thing working in his favor was the weather: a heavy rain had
descended on the Los Angeles area, blocking the sun, making daylight dark. The
blurry atmospheric mess protected him, like a heavy blanket of confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He figured it had been
less than four minutes since he'd called for backup. It felt like hours. He
felt compelled to jump up and lay fire toward the gunman, but his training
contradicted his instinct, told him to hold his position, gun in hand, and wait
for support, support he hoped he'd get before he was discovered. Even in the
face of how badly outmatched he was, he was surprised at how calm he felt: out
in the open, he knew he stood little to no chance. His department-issue nine
millimeter offered him absolutely no reassurance over a madman with a machine
gun. His only salvation might come from a quick shot over the hood of his car.
A lucky shot. Until that opportunity insinuated itself into his reality, he'd
hold fast and hope the madman would move away from him, toward the rows of cars
in the parking lot behind the bank, to chase shadows in the rain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>But the gunman had
other plans, continued advancing. Like he knew where he was. Like he could
sense his position behind the cruiser. He let go another three quick rounds. <i>pop-pop-pop!</i>
A windshield to the left of him exploded, showering him with fine shards of
glass. He risked a glance around the front tire of his car, rainwater streaming
over his head, wrapping around his eyes, and blurring his vision slightly. He
saw two boots and the muzzle of an AK-47 approximately eight feet from his
position. The man's gun was down to his side, hanging there, momentarily
disengaged from its deadly business. Tobias made a split-second decision, knew
it might be now or never. He took three short, quick breaths, gripped the
handle of his gun. He figured the man to be about six foot two, figured he
should draw and point at a 30 degree level of inclination above the horizontal,
decrementing the angle gradually as his lifted himself fully off the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He slowly moved his
feet so they were positioned directly beneath him, so his legs tensed like
coiled springs. He made a silent three-count, then pushed up. From there,
everything happened in slow motion. As his arms and head thrust up from behind
the hood of his cruiser, he fired his first shot. It was low but centered. It
hit the gunman in the chest, pushing him back slightly, the bullet falling
ineffectively as it bounced off the man's Kevlar vest. As he moved to a
half-upright stance, he lowered his aim a little and let off another round.
This one found its mark. Still a little low, it hit the man in the side of the
neck. The wound spurted a small quantity of arterial blood. The gunman seemed
surprised for a moment, appeared to not completely understand what was rising
off the hood of the car in front of him. But he appeared to understand the
apparition was a threat, so he quickly raised his left arm, leveling the AK-47
at Tobias. The last shot Tobias got off was in a full upright stance. He
squeezed the trigger. The shot moved from the barrel of his gun to the center
of the man's forehead in less than 1/1000 of a second. A split second later,
the bullet and a pink mist raced from the back of the gunman's head. A second
after that the gunman was on the ground, dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Tap-tap-tap!</i>
Lieutenant Dursk rapped on the window of the police cruiser for the third time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey Tobias! Wake
up!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias snapped upright
in his seat, reached for his holster, then understood he'd been asleep in his
car, jolted out of a flashback of his first and only kill as a law enforcement
officer. The man he'd killed was named Vick Corinsky, a journeyman violent
offender who'd been released from prison only five months before. Conrinsky had
just robbed the First National Bank of California, and Tobias happened to roll
up to the scene just before he exited. Corinsky emerged, found his driver had
fled, and subsequently panicked. He dropped his bag of cash and began
inexplicably firing into the parked vehicles around him. Tobias would only
later understand the man had lowered his weapon in the end because he'd seen
the waves of polices cars coming in from all directions, knew there was no way
out. Tobias didn't have the advantage of seeing the police approach, couldn't
hear the sirens due to the ringing in his ears and the deluge around him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd killed a guy who
had already surrendered. The department, however, didn't see it that way. After
a brief investigation, he was cleared of any wrong-doing, even promoted. In
spite of his exoneration, he'd had struggled with the kill for over a year,
even sought counseling in addition to that required by his department. As time
passed, though, his memories of the event slowly dissipated, receded into the
background of this thoughts, only to be thrust to his center of attention when
certain things triggered a recall. Like incessant tapping on a car window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, man, you
okay?&quot; Asked Dursk, looking a little concerned now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked forward
through the windshield of his car, noting none of his surroundings had changed
significantly since he closed his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, I'm
fine.&quot; He yawned. &quot;How long have I been out?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dursk looked at his
watch, took a pull on his cigarette. &quot;'Bout an hour and a half. Did you
have a nice nap?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I guess it was
okay. What'd you find?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cake.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Cake?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Searched the
logs. It was all there. Indicated Hassenback and Eduardo communicated last on
the 14th.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No shit?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, and it gets
better. Orange is the provider for Eduardo too. We have his address,
Tobias.&quot; Dursk took a step back from the vehicle, took a long,
satisfactory drag of his cigarette, and gloated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias gripped the
wheel of his car, then released it. He gave Dursk a smile and reached for his
PDA. As he was about to ask Dursk for the address, he was hit with a small wave
of confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;When was the last
email exchange between them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;The 14th,&quot;
replied Dursk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;That's
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Idon't follow.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dursk looked doubtful,
and Tobias knew exactly what he was thinking: In most cases timestamps are
immutable pieces of forensic evidence, especially when they're taken from a
transaction log maintained by an ISP. He was sure the date was fine, but the
email hadn't come from Hassenback, and he was sure that was very bad news for
Eduardo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Because, my
friend, our Mr. Hassenback was laying on a metal slab in the county morgue on
the 14th.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias looked again
through the windshield, massaging his chin with his left hand as he held his
PDA with his right. Then the truth hit him like a brass-knuckled right. He
started his car, pressed on his brake, and slammed the shifter into drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What's the
address?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Suddenly Dursk
understood what Tobias was thinking. &quot;You don't think ...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes, I do.
Address.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;1131 Parton, Unit
233. Right in the middle of Santa Ana.&quot; He handed Tobias a scrap of paper
with the details, then said, &quot;Oh, and full name's Eduardo Gutierrez.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias took the paper,
folded it, placed it in his shirt pocket, then turned back to the lieutenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Thanks for your
investment in this, Lieutenant. If there's anything I can do to reciprocate in
the future, let me know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dursk shook his head.
&quot;Don't worry about it. Like I said before, if all of this shit is going to
where you said it is, there's just no place for it. We're going to stay here
for a while, follow the data trail until we hit walls, and then see what we
got. You need to get out of here. I sure hope to hell you're wrong about that
Eduardo fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah, me
too.&quot; Tobias released his foot from the brake pedal, slammed the
accelerator to the floor, and screamed out of the parking lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He took North Grand
Avenue south to Santa Ana. The traffic was terrible, but it beat the perennial
metallic crawl that inched the length of the Five almost all hours of the day.
As he made his way past East 17th Street, he took a chance and gave Sanchez a
call. Perhaps he'd be in a position that would get him to Eduardo more quickly.
After three rings, Sanchez picked up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yo!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, kid. Good
news and bad news.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay. Give me the
good news first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I have Eduardo's
address, so it looks as though we got our first big break on this one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;So what's the bad
news.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I think he's
probably dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I can explain
later. Right now, I need to know how close you are to downtown Santa Ana.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Your lucky day,
boss. I was just on my way back to the office. I'm up off from 14th and Bristol
now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Perfect. You in a
cruiser?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Make some noise,
then, and get to 1131 Parton, Unit 233 as fast as you can. I don't have to tell
you to knock first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;But you're going
to anyway, right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. If there's
no answer, get the apartment manager, then wait for me with the key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias met Sanchez and
the apartment manager, an apple-shaped, wrinkled Hispanic man by the name of
Hector Ruez, in front of Eduardo's apartment. Noting Sanchez already had the
keys to the unit in his hand, he turned his attention to Hector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Sir, I'm going to
have to ask you for another favor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yes. What I do
for you?&quot; The old man's voice was distorted with a phlegmy, exaggerated
accent that made him sound something like an old Tony Montana with a very bad
head cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;We're going to
need to evacuate the adjacent units, including upstairs and down. Just a matter
of precaution.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez both
unbuttoned the straps that secured their firearms to their holsters and placed
their hands firmly on the butts of their guns. As they set about securing the
front of the apartment, Hector tried in vain to roust the tenants in the
adjacent units. After knocking several times on each of the surrounding eight
doors, he returned to Tobias, shrugged, and said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;There look no
like they is home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias expected as
much, said, &quot;Thank you for your cooperation, sir. Now if you could go
downstairs and wait for us in your office, we'll be along shortly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The old man seemed to
know the drill, turned, and headed down the stairs. Tobias nodded at Sanchez,
who took the apartment key and inserted it into the lock in Eduardo's door,
stretching his left arm across its width while keeping most of his body away
from its center. Tobias quickly moved to a position directly behind his
partner, gun drawn in a two-fisted grip. Sanchez removed his firearm with his
right hand and slowly turned the key with his left. The lock released; the door
gave and opened slightly inward. Sanchez moved his left hand to its lower-left
corner and pushed it open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias immediately saw
the body, the late-morning shaft of sunlight laying its incongruous warmth
across the cold, hours-old corpse, painting Eduardo up in a bizarre mix of
Munch and Rembrandt. Tobias holstered his gun, Sanchez did the same, and they
walked into the apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Shit.&quot; Tobias
exhaled as he swore, emphasizing the terminating consonant for good measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You want to tell
me how you knew we were going to find Eduardo like this?&quot; Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Dursk. He told me
Eduardo and Hassenback last corresponded on the 14th. Of course, that couldn't
have been because Hassenback was a db then. On a slab.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You know what
that means, right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah. It means
our perp's one or two steps ahead of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;And he's probably
got a really good idea about the location of the facility behind the marketing
literature; that is, if Eduardo had really been there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Okay, so besides
calling this in, what should we do now?&quot; Sanchez gave Tobias a look the
detective quickly understood: let the tech's in right now, they may not ever find
this guy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I'll call it in
later. Let's get some gloves and booties, then bag all the mail we can. Pay
particular attention to bank statements and credit card bills. If this guy's
actually been to that facility, maybe we can establish a paper trail.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You mean follow
the money?&quot; Asked Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.
Exactly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark had been
thinking about where to dispose of Chuck's body before it had even hit the
ground. The encroaching daylight and the growing congestion on the roadways
prohibited dumping it locally. Instead, he'd have to find some place remote, a
place that would provide the cover the receding darkness no longer could. By
the time he had Chuck loaded in the trunk, he'd decided where to take him. He
headed east on Edinger Avenue, doing his best to blend into the light, early
morning traffic, paying particular attention to posted speed limits. He was
driving a stolen car with a dead body in the trunk. Not a good combination if
he got pulled over. After several minutes on Edinger, he headed north on the
405, then got on the 10 until he reached the Pacific Coast highway. He took the
PCH to Topanga Canyon Boulevard, then drove up the windy, coastal mountain road
until he found a suitable dirt road careening off to the right. He drove about
100 yards off the main road and stopped the car. From beginning to end, the
whole trip had taken him just over an hour and a half.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He shut down the
engine, killed the lights, and exited the vehicle. He took several deep breaths
of the fresh, rural air. It smelled like a salty farm. It smelled like home. It
filled him with a healthy, morning medicine that helped purge the smoke from his
lungs, burn the nicotine out of his system. He stood next to the car, bathed in
a dark, morning shadow. In LA, the sun would be shining with its glorious
morning warmth, a warmth that would in a few hours turn into an afternoon
sizzle. In the hills above Topanga Canyon, however, the shadows continued to
obscure the landscape, adding a muddy confusion to help cover his movements. He
hurried around to the rear of the car, popped the trunk, lifted Chuck, and
shouldered him. He carried him to the nearest tree, propped his body against
its trunk, and headed back to the car. There was no sense in trying to hide the
body. Even out in the relative wilderness of the hills to the east of Malibu,
Chuck would be found. It really didn't matter to Clark when that happened,
just so long as he wasn't there when it was discovered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He returned to the
Mustang, decided on a more leisurely ride back. If he timed it right, he'd
arrive at the apartment complex at the midpoint between the morning rush and
lunchtime. He turned on the radio, adjusted the tuner until he found a news
station, then got caught up in a story about a recent quake in the Caribbean,
the length of the program taking him all the way back into the heart of LA. As
he headed back up Edinger Avenue, he turned the radio off and thought about his
next move. He decided that after retrieving his truck, he'd return to his room,
collect what little possessions he had there, then immediately head out to the
desert. He needed to find a way into the hills north of the 15 that would allow
him to do reconnaissance, find the facility, assess its security, determine its
weaknesses. As he was deciding whether to camp or stay in Baker, he saw a
patrol car in his rearview mirror. It had its lights on. And it was closing
fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He was about a
block from where he needed to be. He had no options. He couldn't ditch the car
and run. Too much stuff, too little time. Besides, grabbing him would be as
easy as bagging a dog with two legs. One man against the LAPD was no match, not
out in the open in broad daylight anyway. He grasped the steering wheel
tightly, sweat from his palms slowly eroding his grip. He forced himself to
look ahead, but the lights in his mirror told him he needed to get to the
right. Just as he was about the pull to the side of the road, the patrol car
screamed past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>His panic eased.
He realized he was holding his breath and let it out. He dried his hands on his
pants, continued to roll slowly up the street. As he turned on Parton, he got
his first clear view of the apartment complex. What he saw brought the panic
back in spades: just under Eduardo's unit, he counted no less than three
unmarked cars, six patrol cars, and a crime scene unit. He continued driving.
He could forget about his truck. He could forget about his perceived lead on
the authorities, too. All that was done. And all he'd worked for over the past
two years now seemed to be hanging in the balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Situation? Grim.
He'd killed three men. He was still driving a stolen car. And he was driving it
right past an apartment that contained the body of one of his victims. He was
too close to the crime scene, and the car was definitely too hot to be driving.
He needed another vehicle. He needed cash. He needed to get out of town. For
the first time he could remember, he needed help. He picked up his phone,
flipped it open, and dialed the number of the only person he figured might
deliver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>_____________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick got the call at
4:30 in the morning. The guy he'd received most of his instructions from,
Manheim, told him the ranch needed another asset, their shitty euphemism for
telling him he needed to abduct another little girl to serve up to the
slimy-ass bastards who visited the boss's spread outside of Baker. He really
didn't like what he'd been doing, could barely tolerate it. He'd done
abductions before, just not children. He'd worked for a mob boss in Las Vegas
for a couple of years, and most of the people he'd picked up were slime-balls
who owed a lot of cash to the Vegas Mafia. Those abductions, however, didn't
pay that well. Not like these. Not even close.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jason Dungston was
another aspect of the job he barely tolerated. Jason was his new partner, the
guy he was supposed to break in. But the man was a moron, and he'd demonstrated
on various occasions that his diminished mental capacity was going to either
get them killed or jailed. Eventually. With Jason, it was just a matter of
time. No, he didn't like what he was doing, and he didn't like who he was doing
it with. At this point, he was only staying because he was broke. That and he
liked money. A lot. And the cash for a patrol was good. The cash for a pick-up
was even better. One more pickup, and he'd have enough money in the bank to
last him a year. Enough to get out of the sleazy operation he'd somehow gotten
himself into. After that: fuck Jason, and fuck the organization too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick drove east on the
91, enjoying the silence afforded him by the task at hand. He was in charge of
the abduction, and those were always executed solo. That meant no Jason, at
least for a while. And that translated into a less risky morning, with the
added bonus of not having to listen to the man's drool-laced, low-brow blather
that seemed to always be erupting from his stupid mouth. He forced the thoughts
of his partner out of his mind. Instead, he concentrated on the overall
handling of the car, which was a late-model Honda Civic, a vehicle that
saturated the streets in Southern California. He chose it because it matched
almost exactly the car driven by the parents of the girl. He'd boosted it just
after 7 AM, right after its owner had stepped out of it and into a low-rise
building full of low-paid government workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In his experience,
abductions had always been carried out with stolen vehicles, even when he'd
worked in Vegas. Under both organizations, the stolen vehicle is used long
enough to make the abduction, after which he would immediately rendezvous with
a company-owned vehicle. This keeps the organization's assets clean during the
period of highest risk. Once the swap is made, the stolen vehicle is scrubbed
and abandoned. If it's found,  the police typically chalk the theft up to kids
joy riding, in which case they don't even bother with printing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> Once he hit Riverside,
Rick took the University Avenue exit, heading east. He followed University for
about a mile, took a left on Franklin Avenue, followed by another left on 5th
Street. The girl lived on 5th Street, which was exactly one block north of
Longfellow Elementary, the school she attended, probably as a third-grader.
Rick made a mental note of the girl's address, then spent the next two hours
driving through the surrounding streets. Driving streets allowed him to gauge
traffic levels and avoid unforeseen obstacles such as road work and dead-ends, which
allowed him to choose an optimal exit route. After running through his options,
he decided his post-abduction route would take him north to Third Street. From
there, he'd head east, then take the 215 up to San Bernardino, where he'd meet
Jason at the Central City Mall for the hand-off. Afterward, his part would be
done. He'd get the car cleaned, abandon it at the mall, and then get a bus
ticket back to LA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick looked at the
clock on the console of the Civic. It was 10:30 in the morning. He had about
five hours to kill until the girl got out of school. Five hours until boredom
turned into a torturous, hour-long adrenaline rush. He could do without the
risk-induced stress, but at forty grand a snatch, he figured it was worth it.
He also figured he'd do this one last job and get the hell out of LA forever.
Maybe move to South America where the living is cheap. Maybe even try to get
clean. He looked at the clock on the dash again. It still said 10:30. It was
going to be a long day. He worked his way once more along his planned exit
route, deciding this time he'd take it to San Bernardino and check out the
drop-off point at the mall. After that, he'd head to Victorville, get some
lunch, and then head back to Riverside. The trip would likely burn at least a few
hours, which would keep him out of Riverside and minimize his exposure in the
neighborhoods surrounding the school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick returned from
Victorville at three in the afternoon. He drifted by Longfellow Elementary,
circled around the block, and parked on the corner of Eucalyptus and 5th,
betting the girl would choose the shortest, most direct route to her house.
While he waited, he pulled out her photo, studying it for what felt like the
hundredth time, firming up his best guess regarding her height and weight,
length of hair, facial features, and style of clothing. Ten minutes later,
school let out, and children began filing past him on their way home, walking,
talking, and playing, oblivious to the world around them. It took about 20
minutes for all of them to march past, not one of them matching the photograph.
He waited another 15 minutes just be sure she hadn't had a late start home,
then switched strategies and began randomly driving one of three pre-selected
loops that would take him past the girl's house every 15 minutes. At 4:30 in
the afternoon, he rolled down 5th Street for a final pass. The girl was nowhere
to be found, and the daily business of the neighborhood was picking up with
returning parents. Too dangerous to continue surveillance, and certainly too
risky to even think about an abduction, he followed his exit route to the 215
and headed toward Victorville. As he merged into the right-hand lane, he
flipped his phone open and dialed Frank Malone, his immediate supervisor, but a
guy he rarely spoke to. After several rings, Frank answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You got the
package?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What
happened?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Inventory
problem. Out of stock.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Shit. Okay. Let's
check again tomorrow. Let Jason know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick pressed the end
button on his phone, then dialed Jason. He could think of hundreds of more
appropriate names for the guy, most of them ending in the word <i>shit</i>.
Jason answered immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, you got
her?&quot; Jason sounded annoyed, perhaps even a little manic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Who?&quot; Rick
played coy, hoping the dumbshit on the other end of the line would understand
they shouldn't be broadcasting the details of their business to the rest of the
world on an unsecured cellular signal. The thought flashed again through his
mind: <i>one of these days, that fuck is going to get us jailed or killed</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Who the fuck do
you <i>think</i> I'm talking about, bozo? The girl you were supposed to pick up
today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;I have no idea
what you're talking about. Is this Mark?&quot; Rick rattled off a number that
didn't match the one he'd dialed, hoping Jason would remember protocol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Quit fucking
around, Rick.&quot; And then, &quot;Oh, shit. Right. I gotcha.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick said nothing.
After a moment, Jason said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Did you pick up
the merchandise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick pulled his
attention away from the phone, caught himself starting to drift onto the
shoulder. He shook his head at no one and just laughed. The stupid fucker
thought the pause in the conversation would be sufficient to remove any mix-up
regarding its underlying meaning, nullify what had been said before it. As he
worked to move past his incredulity at his Jason's boundless stupidity, he
looked ahead and noticed a gas station looming in the distance. One of those
large, trucker-oriented facilities that also catered to weary car-bound
travelers. Rick slowed, pulled into the station, and parked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You still
there?&quot; Jason asked. Impatience again, this time salted with more than a
little arrogance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;You're gonna
hafta go again tomorrow. You ready for that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Of course. Why
wouldn't I be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just wanna make
sure you can stomach it, smalls.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick looked out the
windshield of the car. A family of three was just exiting the store. A small
kid, about four, toddled next to his dad, one hand clutching the man's
pant-leg, the other tightly grasping a candy bar. They looked happy. Normal,
middle-class family out for an afternoon. He remembered how horribly boring
that lifestyle had seemed to him when he was a young man. He now caught himself
at times longing for it. Longing for the stability. One more job. He'd get the
money, split, and start over. He gave the family one more look, then returned
his attention to the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hey, where you
staying tonight?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Laying low. Motel
Six. Out of town a bit. Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Wanna have a
little fun?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Whatcha got in
mind?&quot; Jason seemed to perk up, dropped the attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Was thinking
about picking up some beers, grabbing some girls, and heading out to the
desert. How's that sound?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hell yeah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Good. You in the
Six north of town?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;303.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Pick you up a
little after eight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rick slapped his phone
shut and placed it in the car's center console. He then reached under his seat
and removed a 9mm Beretta he'd stowed there earlier. He wasn't supposed to pack
during a pick-up, but that was one rule he couldn't go along with. No way he
was going to boost a car, troll a seedy neighborhood full of paranoid illegals,
and execute an abduction of a little girl unless he had protection. To do
otherwise would be crazy. He ejected the clip and inspected it. It was full. Of
course he knew that because he'd topped it earlier. But there's a rule you
follow regarding guns and life-threatening situations: check your shit two
times to make sure. Once you're sure, check it again. He slapped the clip back
in, chambered a round, and clicked the safety on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He started the car,
pulled back onto the 215, heading toward San Bernardino. The plan was simple:
he'd pick up Jason, take him to the desert, shoot the fucker between the eyes,
then head up to Victorville. The next day, with any luck, he'd grab the girl,
make the transfer himself, and complete the delivery. He'd tell the boss Jason
had issues with the operation, was complaining about the money. He'd tell him
Jason was going to go to the cops unless he got a better deal. He'd tell him
he'd had no choice but to kill the man. If everything worked out all right,
he'd get Jason's share for the delivery, maybe even something for the kill.</p>
