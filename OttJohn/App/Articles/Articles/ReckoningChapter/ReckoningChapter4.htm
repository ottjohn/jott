<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark's Friday had
started with the purchase of two hard drives that were a little larger than the
one he'd taken from Hassenback's computer. He needed them to image it, which
would allow him to work with an exact copy of the drive rather than use it
directly. That's the first rule of computer forensics. Make a copy. Don't use
the original. Bad things happen when you do that. He'd preached that to his
students over and over, in his former life. Using the original is risky, opens
the door to equipment failure, inadvertent writing, and the activation of
data-munching trojans, things that really don't matter much with a copy. It can
be replaced. The original can't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was his
practice to make two copies of everything. He expected failures and experienced
them often enough. Imaging one drive is time consuming; imaging two is almost
unbearable.  It would take the better part of the day just to get the copies
made and ready for interrogation, roughly sixteen hours. Downtime. He couldn't
do any work while his laptop managed the process, so he spent most of the time
catching up on sleep. He hadn't realized how tired he'd been, though. The
previous two weeks of surveillance and planning had him working eighteen hour
days the whole way, so sleep came easy. So easy, he'd slept through all of
Friday and into Saturday morning, waking only occasionally to check on the
progress of the drives.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At five in the
afternoon on Saturday, Clark sat at the table in his weekly staring at a bag of
tacos he'd picked up at a local fast food place. He'd spent the better part of
the day organizing the data on the imaged drives, preparing them for a
systematic search that would consume at least another two days. The smell of
grease wafted the air, momentarily taking his mind from the retrospective of
his latest operation. It was another thing he'd always done after an
interrogation: review everything that had transpired during the operation,
giving himself scores for its different components, then writing a synopsis of
what could have gone better, and what he'd executed well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He really didn't
want to think about this one, didn't want to consider the mistakes he'd made.
Of all the interrogations he'd conducted, the retrospective from the last one
promised to teach him more about operational protocol than all the others
combined. He removed one of the tacos from its wrapper and took a bite. Not
very good. High in fat, low quality beef, probably no milk at all in the
cheese. He drowned it in hot sauce, hoping the condiment would cure the flavor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It hadn't gone
very well. He gave himself high marks for data acquisition, but he failed
miserably on the interrogation. He'd let his emotions get the better of him and
blown it. Over the past couple of years, He'd viewed prodigious amounts of
child pornography, images he was sure would haunt him for the rest of his life.
But he had to, had no choice in the matter. He had to find a clue, a
connection, something that would give him direction. And he thought he'd seen
it all, too. But he was wrong. He closed his eyes, thought about what had
burned into his mind that evening, wondered if he could have done things a
little differently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Hope for a
productive interrogation had died with the images that flickered on
Hassenback's television, images that seeped into his thoughts like a toxic
sludge. He'd only glimpsed some of it, but what he'd seen had been enough.
There was a girl, perhaps seven. She was alone on a bed in a dimly-lit room
that looked like a dungeon. She had short brown hair and a soft, oval face that
was pale with blotchy purple marks that undoubtedly came from beatings. Her
large, brown eyes stared up toward the ceiling. They looked hollow, the kind
you see in drug addicts at the apex of their highs. She twisted slowly, her
naked body rolling over a pool of blood puddled on the sheets between her legs.
He remembered looking away then. It was not the image of the girl that had
caused him to momentarily lose focus, to seek shelter in the dullness of wood
flooring. It was the sheets. They were plastic. And he knew what was coming
next. He forced himself to look again, tried to deny what he was seeing,
rationalize it somehow. As his eyes returned to the screen, he noticed the
girl's head had changed slightly: a small, red dot decorated the middle of her
forehead. Blood trickled from it as her eyes stared out into the room,
comprehending nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>She was dead. He
remembered his heart beat notch up so high it felt as if it were going to burst
through his chest. His head felt like it was evaporating, his skin began to
crawl, and his fingertips numbed a little. At that moment, he felt as if the
entire house were closing in on him. He felt confused, like a caged animal. All
he wanted to do was run, get away. His breathing became erratic. He found it
difficult to control. Then he forced himself to look at Hassenback. That
brought him focus. And purpose. He took three quick steps across a floor that
somehow had turned spongy, and then nearly ripped the man's head off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd thought about what
to do with the DVD while ripping the house apart. He didn't want to make a
copy, really didn't know if he could stomach seeing the little girl again, what
she had to endure. But he knew he had to. There could be information there he
could use, and the potential of good information outweighed his instinctual
need to protect the fortitude of both his stomach and mind. So he copied it to
a secure thumb drive, returned it to the player, advanced it to the track that
showed the murder, and pressed pause. He'd given some consideration about
whether he should even leave the DVD but decided law enforcement needed to know
Hassenback had not rehabilitated. He was not the victim of a senseless crime.
He knew they still had to do their jobs, try to find him and prosecute him, but
perhaps the DVD would make them a little less careful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was no other
possible end to the operation, no way he could have watched that image and not
react the way he did. Yes, it may have cost him valuable information he
could've collected through persuasive conversation, but trying to control his
reaction would have been as unproductive as trying to reverse the tides. He
shook the memory from his mind, tried to focus on the task at hand. But he
failed. He looked at his watch. It was 6:45 PM. He put the taco down. He'd lost
his appetite. What he needed was an ice-cold beer. He locked his computer,
grabbed the keys to his truck, and walked out the door of the weekly. He had no
idea where he was heading, but he figured just about any place would do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hi, Papa!"
exclaimed the little girl over the phone. "You see the new dolly I got? She's
pretty. She says she lubs you." The little girl giggled, always happy to speak
to her grandfather.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The sound of her
voice was good medicine. It seemed that whatever bothered Tobias, Sarah and her
wonderful, imaginative conversations always impacted him in a profoundly good
way, notwithstanding their sometimes truncated nature. She was, after all, only
four. She didn't have to say anything special; all she had to do was talk. As
Sarah gabbed on about her dog, her parents, what she wanted for Christmas, and
how much she wished it would snow, Tobias' horrific memories of the DVD faded,
if only temporarily, into the fog in the back of his mind. He knew they'd lurk
there, like a big cat in a black jungle, just waiting to pounce. Later in the
evening, when he closed his eyes for the night, he knew the cat would slink to
the foreground, bringing with it the awful image of that little girl. Now,
however, he gave silent thanks for the reprieve, complements of the wonderful
color and simplicity of Sarah's world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I do see your
dolly! What's her name?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Wendy. And she
has a potty mouth! She said something bad." She whispered, inflecting the last
word to accentuate the gravity of doll's offense. "So I put her time-out. Hi
wiwey!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Evidently, the
family dog had interjected itself into the conversation. Tobias got in an "I
love you, Sarah," just as she passed the phone back to her mother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Well, I guess
that's all she wants to do with you!" Said Anne, laughing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah. But it was
nice. I really needed to hear her voice. Yours too," Tobias replied, choking a
little on the last words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"How bad was it,
daddy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Bad. Worst I've
ever seen. And, as usual, I can't talk about it. Thanks for asking though. Just
wanted to hear your voices. You know how I get. I'm a big baby." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Oh shush!" She
admonished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The line went
quiet. Slowly, Sarah's little island of peace was being replaced with the
jungle cat, the images slipping into his mind, stalking his thoughts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tell Sarah her
papa loves her. I love you too, honey," he said, preparing to hang up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Hey, how about a
BBQ at your place Tomorrow? Brandon doesn't have to work, and it'd be good to
catch up some. We haven't seen you two in about a month." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias had a
strong character; people in his position have to; otherwise, they turn into
alcoholics and become social disasters. Given the intermittent peaks of stress
in their lives, it's no wonder cops have one of the highest divorce rates in
the nation. Many just can't handle the stress of the job and a social life at
the same time. But even well-adjusted cops sometimes run into cases that bring
them to the brink. And Anne understood that. She always had. And her
self-invitation couldn't have come at a better time: he couldn't think of
anything better than a day full of family, food, drink, and big doses of his
granddaughter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Sounds like a
great plan, sweetie. Give your mom a call tomorrow so we can set up a time; and
don't bring anything. We've got it covered. Love you.&quot; Tobias paused for
just a moment, then said, &quot;Thanks." Then he cradled the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Did that help?"
Carol asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He knew it was a
rhetorical question. Whenever he had particularly bad days, he would give his
daughter a call, try to lose himself in conversation with her and his
granddaughter. It was medicine to him, gave him a psychological boost to help
him climb out of the hole some of his cases put him into. He made the calls
mostly during investigations of crimes against women and children. And when a
child got hurt, he especially wanted to talk to Sarah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias regarded
Carol as much more than a wife. She completely balanced him with the warm,
comfortable companionship that most can look for their whole lives and never
find. She was his best friend, his soul mate. She filled his life with artistic
and intellectual diversions that carried away most of the occupational hazards
associated with his profession. She was his rudder when he had difficulty
steering his sometimes-troubled waters; she was his life-vest when those waters
became ominous and threatened to drown him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>They'd met in
college. Carol was a petite, brainy history major who had the sensuous librarian
look down to an art. She was just under five-ten, blonde hair pulled into a
tight pony tail, blue eyes, and an athletic body she constantly hid with
loose-fitting clothes and over-sized sweaters. Tobias had always thought she
looked like a blonde Audrey Hepburn adorned with tortoise shell glasses. The
first time he saw her, she was playing Cressida in a small campus Shakespearean
production. To the amusement of his friends, Tobias had an unwavering passion
for Elizabethan literature and Metaphysical poetry. While he'd read the play,
he knew it was rarely produced, so he skipped his night class in Biology and
the late-night poker game with his buddies to attend the production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While the
presentation of the play was a little rough, Tobias was captivated by the girl
playing the part of Cressida. She executed her lines flawlessly and did a great
job bringing her character to life. At times, he thought she was looking at
just him, performing for his entertainment only. Of course, this was not the
case; she didn't even know he existed at the time. But his perception spoke to
her ability as a first-rate thespian. As the scenes slipped by, he noticed he'd
been watching less of the play and more of her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When the
performance was over, he felt an overwhelming need to talk to her. He wasn't
looking for a date, but he felt a connection. It wasn't in his nature to just
walk up to a beautiful and talented girl and strike up a conversation: he had
two left feet, a rented tongue that frequently broke down, and a conversation
pattern that was choppier than a wind-whipped sea. His need to speak with her,
though, outweighed all of that. He was petrified when he initially approached
her. Close up, she was striking, had eyes that radiated intelligence. And a
little fire. To his astonishment, though, she'd accepted his invitation for
coffee and a discussion about the play. That night, they began a conversation
that would last for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"You okay,
sweetie?" Asked Carol. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias didn't
answer. He walked over to her, gave her a kiss, and held her. As they embraced,
she freed one of her hands to wipe a tiny tear streaming down the side of his
face, a tear he knew told her in no uncertain terms that this had indeed been a
terrible last couple of days. And it was going to be a long night. She said
nothing, just continued holding him for a moment, then took him by the hand and
lead him to the bedroom.</p>
