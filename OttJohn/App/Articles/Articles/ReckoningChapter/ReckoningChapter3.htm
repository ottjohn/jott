<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Clark studied himself
in the bathroom mirror of his cheap rental, one of the many he'd occupied over
the past couple of years. Without exception, they were all motels, with weekly
rates, anonymity virtually ensured. Walk in, pay cash, no questions asked. No
credit checks, no id required, no hassle. But even when making temporary living
arrangements, he had to be somewhat discriminating: he couldn't patronize any
of the large, expensive chains that required identification, but neither could
he stay at the very low-end establishments that attracted prostitutes and drug
dealers. The former violated his need for anonymity by creating a paper trail;
the latter by attracting the police. Somewhere in the middle, he'd found a
class of weeklies that met his needs, and when he was not on the move and
sleeping in his truck, these were the types of places he would stay to rest and
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>You're a
murderer now</i>, he said to himself. But there was no feeling knit into the
words, none of the self-loathing he'd feared might inflict him after the kill.
And he was glad for it. Because while it was his first, it certainly wouldn't
be his last. He continued regarding himself, looking for some external change
in his demeanor, something that would scream out he'd ended the life of another
human. Some barely-perceptible physical manifestation that would betray him.
But there was nothing, only his reflection: a figure of a man, eyes obscured by
shadow, facial features buried and blurred by darkness. He felt suddenly
detached, as if viewing a stranger. The light filtering into the bathroom from
the tiny living area illuminated him from behind. It made him look like a
sinister angel, unsure about which direction to go, turning his back on the
light and contemplating the darkness. The eyes that stared back at him betrayed
an emptiness that burst within him, a hollowness that filled him completely. He
looked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He'd been operating
under what he'd considered a successful catch-and-release strategy: target,
track, interrogate, move on. In each case, he'd learned enough about his
targets to put together a face-to-face encounter. Most had been house calls, a
few had been abductions. Then he'd press them for information. Some had no
fight in them, gave up everything upon asking. Some had been more difficult.
Some had to be tied up; some had to be terrorized; still others had to be
beaten into talking. In the end, he got what he wanted: electronic, personal,
and extra-personal information that filled in names, places, dates, and methods
of operation. Upon completion of the interrogation, he would have in his
possession information that <i>might</i> be of some use to him, information
that <i>might</i> point him in a positive direction in his search. While that
information could help him, he knew it was damning evidence against those he
targeted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>That's because the
information he collected created a neat package of evidence against every one
of them, evidence that could put each of them back behind bars for a very long
time if it somehow got into the hands of the authorities. And that's how Clark
had left them, with a warning: <i>Say a word about this, even hint it to the
police, and the information I have collected here today is the first thing
they'll see. They'll view me as a tragic figure: a father and husband who lost
everything to an animal just like you. I'll get a slap on the hand. You, on the
other hand, you'll be on your way back to prison. What will become of you then?
Will you choose the protection of a very lonely existence in solitary
confinement or the passionate devotion of a protective and horny lifer?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All of his targets had
understood the message. Except the one in Atlanta. He'd decided to call the
police, and Clark had to make a very fast exit from that city. He'd been very
lucky to have his scanner on, hear the APB, and get out of town. If he'd been
apprehended, his search would have been slowed for some time, if not stopped
altogether. And that was unacceptable. He needed information. He pined for it.
Every waking moment and all his dreams were filled with just one monomaniacal
objective: to add to the growing collection of information he now had. Although
he knew his odds were very long, he was looking for a vector: one piece of
information that would put him on the right path toward the apprehension and
elimination of the animal who took his family away from him. Finding that one
man was the only thing on Clark's mind. It was his great white whale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>He looked again into
the mirror for another few minutes, then turned away. It was a waste of time. He
had a job to do: he had to process the electronic data in his possession, and
he had to cross reference it with information he already had. With each new
target processed, that job became more difficult. But with each new target, he
also felt his path become more clear, began to point in a definite direction.
All he needed now was a break. He filled a Styrofoam cup with the sludge from a
distressed coffee maker that had seen better days, sat at the lone table in his
single-room weekly, and got to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>______________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias and Sanchez
returned to the Hassenback house, found the driveway empty, and pulled into it.
The scene appeared to have been mostly processed. Tobias figured the vic's
presence in the system as a convicted sex offender had pushed the work along
unusually quickly. Funny how that worked. One tech was outside finishing up. He
was checking the seal on an evidence bag, finalizing its disposition for what
might become a key piece in an evidentiary trail that could one day lead to the
prosecution of whoever had disrupted the day-to-day existence of an otherwise
calm California neighborhood. The cop who had been placed at the end of the
driveway to control access to the scene had departed, the interest shown by
curious neighbors had waned, and the bustle of investigators had diminished to
almost nothing. All that was left was the bright yellow tape flapping in the
Santa Ana wind and the tech, who was just leaving. The house beckoned, and
because of the status of the vic, promised oversights Tobias knew he'd probably
find. And he'd have to find them. Not because he cared at all for the late Mr.
Hassenback, but because it was his job. He loved it, and he took pride in doing
it right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias retrieved
his PDA and stepped through the front door, followed closely by Sanchez. As he
expected, he found the living room stripped down: no body, no techs, less
evidence. The couch on which Hassenback expired bore the injuries of newly
inflicted marks caused by swabbing, plucking, and wiping. It had been pushed
against a set of closed, heavy curtains but was still facing the entertainment
center, which no longer held the assortment of CD's and DVD's that had occupied
its shelves only hours before. There was only a 27 inch television and a DVD
player parked on pause. Tobias made a note in his PDA to check it later. He
then moved directly behind the center of the couch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Okay, so the
intruder came up from behind, right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Would be the most
probable route, yeah. Only the hallway could've provided a surreptitious
approach," replied Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Nice word, kid!
'Sec. Let me write that one down." Tobias pantomimed writing the word on an
invisible notepad in his hand as Sanchez smiled. Then he turned from the couch
and walked toward the hallway behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Which room?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"First one. Looks
more like a study than a bedroom, probably a more secure place to lay in wait.
Plus, one of the techs found a slight disturbance in the carpet just inside the
room, a compression consistent with a heavy person standing in one spot for
some time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias walked into
the room, looked around, walked out. He walked down the rest of the hallway and
into both bedrooms. Sanchez had been accurate in his description of the rear of
the house: it had been turned. There could be evidence there, but he doubted
it. The intruder was obviously gloved and had some kind of protective gear on.
The initial forensics had borne that out. He decided to focus on places the
intruder had meaningful contact: the kitchen, the study, and the spot directly
behind the couch. He returned to the study, looked at the tag that was supposed
to mark the slight depression in the carpet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Techs must have
eyes like hawks.&quot; Tobias studied the wall in front of him, found the first
oversight. &quot;Hey, this wall's not marked. We need to make sure that's not
an oversight. He could've been leaning on it for support and transferred
something in the process. Chalk it. Chalk the wall around the closet too. He
couldn't have just stood in the doorway the entire time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Sanchez made a
note, Tobias keyed its redundancy into his PDA. He then exited the study and
moved to the kitchen. He could see right away the tech there had been pretty
busy: a square piece of linoleum had been cut away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;What was all
the excitement here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Tech found a
slight discoloration in the floor, maybe caused by a caustic solution of some
kind. It looked new, so they cut out a piece."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias continued
to look around. For the most part, the techs had done a good job. Better than
he'd expected. As he looked over the kitchen, he noted in his PDA that it, too,
had been searched: plates were stacked on the counters, shelves emptied, even
the refrigerator looked rummaged. He followed a line from the countertops to
the fridge to the wall, and up to the ceiling. Even the covers for the vents
had been removed. The thoroughness made him wonder what the guy was so
desperate to find, but he figured he already had a good idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Whoever this guy
is, if nothing else, he's a meticulous bastard." Tobias commented, mostly to
himself. Satisfied the kitchen and dining area had been processed sufficiently,
Tobias turned and made his way back to the living area. He moved behind the
couch and stood there. He thought about the pains the intruder took to search
the house. Then he thought about the apparent lack of struggle with Hassenback.
It was like the intruder had snuck up behind him and simply broke his neck.
First thing. If his hunch was right about why the intruder had been there in
the first place, though, why would he do that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"This doesn't make
sense.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Unless it really
was a robbery," offered Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah, but
nobody's going to kill <i>for</i> porn. They might kill <i>because</i> of it,
though. Why do you think the intruder searched the house?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"'Cause he wanted
something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"He took computer
equipment, but it doesn't look like he took much else. We really don't know for
sure, but maybe he was just after the hard drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right. So perhaps
we can assume the intruder turned the house looking for <i>more</i> computer
equipment, like spare hard drives, thumb drives, CD's, DVD's, etc. And why
would he do that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Because he was
after what was on the media.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"And what do you
suppose Hassenback kept on his storage devices?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"But I thought we
already decided the intruder wasn't after porn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Begins with an
I.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez slumped
his shoulders, let out an audible sigh, and rolled his eyes slightly.
"Internet?" He asked, sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"No. I-N. What do
computers do, Sanchez?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Information."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah.
Intriguing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez looked
puzzled. &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He took
information. Which means Hassenback might not have any connection with the guy
who killed him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Why's
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;He took
information, Sanchez. That seems pretty clear. I think he's trying to track
someone down. I don't think he's there yet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez shook his
head. &quot;Sorry boss, but I don't follow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias spread his
arms out at his sides as he looked at Sanchez. &quot;If Hassenback had
committed a sexual crime against one of the intruder's children, then killing
him would have completed the guy's business. But that's not what happened. He
searched the house <i>after</i> the murder. Why search the house after you
killed the guy who hurt one of your kids?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez thought
about it for a moment. &quot;Perhaps he was after porn after all, then? Perhaps
he wanted to make certain Hassenback had no photos or videos of his child." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Stop it, Sanchez!
You're ruining my moment!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"I do my best. But
think about it: if his kid's picture's in there and he doesn't grab it, then we
can work on identifying him through the images."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Your point is
well taken, kid, but I don't think it's correct. Could be, but I doubt it. The
guy was rummaging through the house like he had all the time in the world. I
mean, look at this place. If he didn't feel pressed at all, then why not just
destroy the equipment here? He could've simply stuck what he found in the sink,
broken it, set it on fire, whatever. So why take it? It appears he's been
pretty smart about everything else he's done, so why would he make the mistake
of absconding with equipment if all he's after is its destruction? Doesn't make
sense.&quot; Tobias paused for a moment, then continued. &quot;This guy's after
information. Maybe on one of Hassenback's buddies. There's just one thing
that's a little confusing to me, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez nodded.
"No evidence of interrogation. Because if there had been an interrogation, then
there would have been some kind of struggle. And there's nothing to indicate
that. So if he was after information, why didn't he question Hassenback?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"That's the
sixty-four dollar question, kid. He should've. I can't believe he didn't want
to. So something must've caused him to change his plan."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Like
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Don't know.
Not sure if that it matters.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tobias walked to
the front of the hallway, from where the intruder must have been watching
Hassenback. He looked at the back of the couch; he looked at the television.
Then he went through the mental gymnastics one more time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"If the intruder
was able to sneak up and snap Hassenback's neck, he was certainly capable of
sneaking up and subduing him for questioning."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"But something
changed his mind," said Sanchez.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Right.&quot;
Tobias looked again at the television. He could see most of the screen from
where he was standing. Then he remembered the player was still on pause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Hassenback
was watching something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;How do you
know that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;Just a
guess. The player's on pause. You got some gloves?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>"Slap some on and
press play."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sanchez put on his
rubber gloves, knelt next to the DVD-player and pressed play. As the images
played out on the television, both officers recoiled, and for the first time in
15 years, Detective Paul Tobias got sick at a crime scene.</p>
