To make a call to the authentication service using AJAX, you will need the following in your script (obviously, the url 
for you is going to be different):
<p />
<pre>
    function Authenticate(DataToSend) {
        var responsePromise = $http({
            method: 'POST',
            url: 'OttjohnAuth.svc/Login',
            data: DataToSend,
            async: false,
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });
        return responsePromise;
    }
    function Logout() {
        var responsePromise = $http({
            method: 'POST',
            url: 'OttjohnAuth.svc/Logout',
            data: null,
            async: false,
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });
        return responsePromise;
    }
</pre>
<p />
This, of course, assumes that the service name is OttjohnAuth. To check authentication on the server side, you use the HttpContext object. This is 
going to be available for you under System.Web. Checking if a user is authenticated is simple:
<p />
<pre>
    HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated
</pre>
<p />
To check if a user in in a role, you can use the following:
<p />
<pre>
    HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("ROLENAME")
</pre>
<p />
These are static methods, so the checks are really simple. That should be all there is to it.
