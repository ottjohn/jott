The first thing you need to decide on when building a membership database is whether you are going to build it yourself or if you are going to
implement a third-party database. I've built custom membership databases before, and they are pretty easy to build, but why bother when you
have something like ASP.NET Membership Services just sitting there for free? Not only that, but ASP.NET Membership Services is also
multi-tenant ready, so you can dive right into confusing yourself and everybody around you instantly.

<p />
As for the above part, that is all I am going to share. Installing the database is really very simple. The hardest part is deciding
on a name. And, honestly, I can't create directions better than those in the article. Once installed, you need to have the following in your
web.config (if you don't know what a web.config is, you're in way over your head for now):
<p />
For basic membership, you need the following
<p />
Note: path System.Web-Membership
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;membership defaultprovider="SqlMembershipProvider" userisonlinetimewindow="15"&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
    &lt;clear /&gt;
    &lt;add name="SqlMembershipProvider"
         type="System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider"
         connectionstringname="[THE NAME OF THE CONNECTION STRING TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP DATABASE]"
         applicationname="[THE NAME OF THE APPLICATION WITHIN THE MEMBERSHIP DATABASE YOU WANT TO INITIALLY CONNECT TO]"
         enablepasswordretrieval="true"
         enablepasswordreset="true"
         requiresquestionandanswer="false"
         passwordattemptwindow="20000"
         requiresuniqueemail="false"
         minrequiredpasswordlength="1"
         minrequirednonalphanumericcharacters="0"
         passwordstrengthregularexpression=""
         passwordformat="Encrypted" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
    &lt;/membership&gt;
</pre>
<p />
The attributes in the XML above are associated with how you describe how you are managing membership in your application. With respect to some of the basics,
if you do not know what a connection string is, then, again, you are in a little over your head. The ApplicationName node simply points to the application 
you defined in the membership database. The database, remember, is multitenant, so you can create as many applications as you like (for instance, if you had a 
stable of shops that sold mostly the same items, and required basically the same backend, you could use this to manage all of them by making it the foundation 
for your database). 
<p />
Further, you can  add a regular expression for password strength right there in the config file. This will automatically
throw an error any time a user tries to create a password that stinks. When you are registering a user, then, you can look at what the membership provider returns
to you and it will actually tell you that the password failed by being too weak. The really important one here is encryption. Of course, passwords should be encrypted. To 
do this, you also need a key. You can create one of these or get it out of the Machine.Config file and put it right under the XML above:
<p />
Note: path System.Web-MachineKey
<p />
<pre>
&lt;machinekey 
    validationkey="41BC83C3C3E2E9D056A651C7F30A4073DF60D109CE47417C7285FE8D6D916D3900491BB6CF2DAC37ACA34CEEBFA3922B2E86998785B9409AF26EA171A4BB8B5C"
            decryptionkey="E08201538FCE972E060E9E0B04BA4223898A880814D704F20B3598CA3951C7A2" validation="SHA1" decryption="AES" /&gt;

</pre>
<p />
To add a roles provider as well, add the following to the config file:
<p />
Note: path System.Web-RoleManager
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;rolemanager enabled="true" defaultprovider="SqlRoleManager"&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
    &lt;clear /&gt;
    &lt;add name="SqlRoleManager" type="System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider" connectionstringname="Membership" applicationname="Membership" /&gt;
          &lt;/providers&gt;
        &lt;/rolemanager&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Notice that in both of these XML snippets, the first thing you see is <clear />. If there are any cached providers or default providers, on application start they
are removed and yours take their place. This is mosty a just-in-case entry. The last thing we need to worrry about is how we determine if a user is indeed
authenticated during method calls (or whether the user can use a particular method at all). We do this with the following snippet:
<p />
Note: path System.Web-Authentication
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;
        &lt;forms cookieless="UseCookies" /&gt;
    &lt;/authentication&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Okay, so we are on our way to setting up Forms Authentication over an ASP.NET Membership provider. Now let's see what we have to do to actually get the cookie.
