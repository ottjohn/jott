    First, we need to work out some kind of contract that will describe what a pie chart looks like. The contract not only has to describe things like titles, colors, fonts, 
    and labels, but it also needs to deescribe the position, radius, segment color, and proportions carried by the things being described in the chart. Most, if not all, of this 
    information should really be populated on the server. If this is for a corporate website, then there will be standards for colors and fonts, and those can probably be hydrated 
    from a query against some backend that contains that stuff. For really simple sites, I guess some of the data in the chart can be populated in the page itself (read "hard-coded").
    I will show you a piece of the contract that I came up with. The part that describes the data. Then we can take a look at the rest of the contract:
<p />
<pre>
    var ChartItemContract = {
        Proportion: 0,
        RadianPosition: 0,
        RadianMeasure: 0,
        FillColor: null,
        ItemLabel: "",
        Path: ""
    }
    </pre>
<p />
    The above contract describes a wedge of a pie chart. If you really want to get down to it, the only two items that really need to be returned
    by the server are Proportion and ItemLabel (just for this piece). As a pie chart is the sum of wedges, we will have an array of these items for each chart. The remaining
    descriptors are either calculated fields or fields that can be managed on the client. Now let's take a look at the parent contract, the one that describes the whole enchilada:
<p />
<pre>
    var ChartContract = {
        Title: '',                      //Title for the chart
        ContainerHeight: 270,           //Describes the height of the container in which the chart is held
        ContainerWidth: 340,            //Describes the width of the container in which the chart is held
        ContainerId: '',                //Describes the id of the container in which the chart is held
        CenterX: 100,                   //Describes the center-x of the chart relative to its container
        CenterY: 150,                   //Describes the center-y of the chart relative to its container
        Radius: 90,                     //Describes the radius of the chart
        CurrentX: 0,                    //Describes the current x-coordinate for drawing in container
        CurrentY: 0,                    //Describes the current y-coordinate for drawing in container
        OldX: 0,                        //Describes the previous x-coordinate for drawing in container
        OldY: 0,                        //Describes the previous y-coordinate for drawing in container
        KeyWidth: 20,                   //Describes the width of each key box on the chart
        KeyHeight: 20,                  //Describes the height of each key box on the chart
        KeyCenterX: 0,                  //Describes the x-center position of the top key box on the chart
        KeyCenterY: 0,                  //Describes the y-center position of the top key box on the chart
        KeyOffsetTop: 40,               //Describes how far down from the upper border I want my keys to start
        KeyOffsetInterval: 40,          //Describes how far apart I want to position the keys vertically
        TitleCenterX: 0,                //Describes the x-center position of the title for the chart
        TitleCenterY: 0,                //Describes the y-center position of the title for the chart
        ItemLabelPaddingLeft: 0,        //Describes the left padding between each label and it's corresponding key
        ChartItems: null                //This is the array of pie wedges described above
    }
    </pre>
<p />
    The only thing here that really needs to come from the server is the chart title (and maybe not even that). Everything else can be controlled locally. As you can see from the parent contract,
    a lot of items here are prepopulated so that each chart in the array will have the same look and feel. The rest of the items are calculated fields based on other
    entries in the chart.
<p />
    As for the array of charts, we need only one last contract:
<p />
<pre>
    var ChartCollectionContract = {
        Charts: null
    }
    </pre>
<p />
    To sum up this part, we have created three contracts that describe an array of charts. Of all the fields here, only a few should come from the server. The rest
    can be populated on the client in the definition of the contract itself or calculated by the JavaScript that builds the charts. In the next section, we will look at the
    JavaScript behind the chart creation.
