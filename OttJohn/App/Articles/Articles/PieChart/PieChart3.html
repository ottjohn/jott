    Okay, before we get to the meat of chart creation, we are going to do a final prep of the contract using JavaScript to calculate some of the fields I listed above. This
    can be done in a controller just before the contract is stuffed into a directive for processing:
<p />
<pre>
    Home.BuildSummaryCharts = function () {

        var ColorArray = new Array("blue", "yellow", "green", "red", "black", "orange");
        var ChartCollection = HomeContracts.GetChartCollectionContract();
        ChartCollection.Charts = new Array();
        var iLen = Home.TasksSummary.length;

        for (var i = 0; i < iLen; i++) {

            var Chart = HomeContracts.GetChartContract();
            Chart.ContainerId = Home.TasksSummary[i].TaskName.replace(/ /g, "") + "holder";
            Chart.Title = Home.TasksSummary[i].TaskName;            //  title for the pie chart
            Chart.KeyCenterX = Chart.CenterX + Chart.Radius + 50;   //  rectangular key center x -- pushed to right. Could be a padding left
            Chart.KeyCenterY = Chart.CenterY - Chart.Radius;        //  rectangular key center y
            Chart.TitleCenterX = Chart.CenterX - Chart.Radius;      //  title center x
            Chart.TitleCenterY = Chart.CenterY - Chart.Radius - 30; //  title center y -- pushed up from top of pie chart
            Chart.ItemLabelPaddingLeft = 0;                         //  Padding between key rectangle and label
            Chart.ChartItems = new Array();                         //  array to hold items returned from server

            for (var j = 0; j < 2; j++) {

                Chart.ChartItems[j] = HomeContracts.GetChartItemContract();
                if (j == 0)
                    Chart.ChartItems[j].Proportion = Home.TasksSummary[i].ProportionCompleted;
                else
                    Chart.ChartItems[j].Proportion = 100 - Home.TasksSummary[i].ProportionCompleted;

                Chart.ChartItems[j].FillColor = ColorArray[j];
                Chart.ChartItems[j].ItemLabel = ItemLabel[j];

            }

            ChartCollection.Charts[i] = Chart;
        }

        Home.ChartContract = ChartCollection.Charts;
    }
    </pre>
<p />
    Obviously, if you are reading this, you are familiar with JavaScript. You self-selected this article. I am, then, going to assume that you are prepared
    enough that I do not have to go through a thorough explanation of what is going on here. Suffice it to say that I am filling out the calculated fields: some
    based on what was returned from the server; some based on items that were hard-coded into the contract. I will give a cursory explanation below in a bulleted 
    list.
<p />
    The only item of real note here is to explain the TasksSummary array, which contains the descriptions of the pie slices for each chart along with the chart name.
    The color array should probably be defined on the server and the color setup made accessible via some kind of GUI (if this is a public-facing site, then design might
    have some consideration here). Note that the id for each chart and the height and width of the box in which it will be contained are specified here. This will be
    important in the next installment.
<p />
    <ul>
        <li>
            var ChartCollection = HomeContracts.GetChartCollectionContract() -- retrieves the definition of the chart collection, unpopulated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            var iLen = Home.TasksSummary.length -- Home is my controller. TasksSummary is another contract that contains the proportions of poeple who have completed 
            a specific report. For each report, then, we have a pie chart; and for each pie chart, we have two segments: the proption of those who have completed the 
            report and the proportion of those who have not.
        </li>
        <li>
            var Chart = HomeContracts.GetChartContract() -- each time we go through a loop, we will be creating a chart, which will be described by it's associated 
            contract. This contract will be added to the ChartCollection cotnract above.
        </li>
        <li>
            Basically, the rest of the code simply puts together the items in the chart. The item count is hard-coded to two since we are working on a simple Yes/No, 
            two segment entity.
        </li>
    </ul>
