    Over the past couple of months, I have been acquainting myself with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). SSRS is a great tool, and you can build reports really quickly
    using it. You can also illustrate your reports with charts, too, if you want to get fancy. The problem with SSRS, though, is that if you want just, say, a pie chart on
    your page, you have to jump through a considerable number of hoops. Basically, get around these hoops, you have to be satisfied with the pie chart in another browser window that 
    displays a page generated by the SSRS web service.

    Okay, so I want some pie charts on my site, and I want to be able to do it quickly. I was thinking about all of the terrible things I could do to make JavaScript draw my
    pie chart for me when I remembered attending a workshop on AngularJS. The Angular app was working with something called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). I thought to
    myself, "Hmmmm. I wonder how long it would take me to learn SVG just enough to build an AngularJS directive that will use SVG to present an array of pie charts on my
    page?" As it turns out, not long (less than a day). The directive part is sort of a directive. It is built as a directive, but I'm sure I've offended some AngularJS purists 
    out there somewhere with the way I implemented it. I will show you anyway.
<p />
    You do not need a third-party tool to help you build your charts in JavaScript. You can use straight-up JavaScript and a canvas and go to town. If you want the chart to 
    look slick, however, you might be better off using a tool. With this in mind, I did a quick internet search and found something called Raphael. I chose it for no 
    particular reason. It was just there. Having said this, here's what we are going to do:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Have a look at the contract that contains the description of the chart array</li>
    <li>Have a look at the JavaScript that builds the pie charts</li>
    <li>Have a look at how the Angular directive works</li>
</ol>
<p />
    Ready?
