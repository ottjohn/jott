The next dialog will ask you to build a connection string for the report server. The simplest way to do this is 
to click the Edit button. You will now see the following:

In the Server Name dropdown, just type a period if you only have a single instance of SQL Server on your machine; 
otherwise, selected a named instance from the list. Just use Windows Authentication, and select a handy database 
name. In your case, make sure that you have access to a table that has a date field. I will not only include a date 
variable here, but I will also include a variable that is represented by an external helper table as well as an 
additional table that helps the helper table (this is called a cascading dependency. It might sound confusing right 
now, but I promise it is not). once you have your database selected, you can test the connection and then click the
OK button. When you get back to your main dialog, click the checkbox next to the label <i>Make this a shared 
data source</i>. Now click the Next button. You will see the following:

In this dialog, you can either place a query, parameterized or not, or the name of a stored procedure, followed by a 
list of parameters. In my case, I am going to put the name of a stored procedure in here:
<p />
<pre>
    exec POSRebateCreditReconcile_Report @beginDate, @endDate, @mainCategory, @subCategory
</pre>
<p />
The rest is just a click-through for styles applied and where you want your fields to go. Having said that, click 
through the Report Type screen, then on the next page, click the Details button until all of the listed columns 
are gone. Here is what I mean:
