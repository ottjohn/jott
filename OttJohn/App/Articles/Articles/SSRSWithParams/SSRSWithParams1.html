Alright, I don't get to use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) that much, so when I get back into it even after some layoff 
it can be a little frustrating getting back into it. There's only one sure-fire cure to get over that: write an article about it. 
First, a little background.
<p />
We have a fairly large need for reporting where I work (any business really should). A few months ago, the boss asked if I could 
make a couple of reports for him as the guy he contracted to initially put together those reports bailed. I said I'd be happy to 
do it, not knowing that the whole thing would actually be pretty simple when not delving into custom reports requiring parameters. 
Actually, parameterless reports are rediculously simple. I will probably write another article on how to create one of those 
later. I will probably also write an article on how to install SSRS on your machine, if you're so inclined to run something like 
that on your PC.

Basically, the only thing you really need to know about SSRS is that it is part of the Develeper Edition of SQL Server, and it is 
also included in every release of SQL Server Standard and above. It's also free if you decided to run it on the same machine that 
hosts SQL Server; otherwise, I think there is a nominal licensing fee for it. You can make your SSRS reports as simply or as 
complicated as you want them to be. For the purpose of this excericise, let's call it advanced simple.
