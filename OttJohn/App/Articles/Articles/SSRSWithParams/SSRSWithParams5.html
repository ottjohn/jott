Now that we have the report defined, we need to publish it, and then have a look at it. Before we can publish it, we 
need to configure its general properties. To do this, right click on the project name and select Properties. You 
will see the following dialog:
<p />

<p />
There are two fields here that you will be interested in. The folder for your reports under this project will be the 
same as the name of your project. If you do not like this, then change the entry under TargetReportFolder. The other 
field, TargetServerUrl, wants to know which url you want to publish your reports to. Simply type in the location of 
your report server. In my case, it is simply http://localhost/reportserver (shhhh. Don't give that url out 
to anyone). Once you've done this, right click on the project and select Deploy. This will publish your report to the 
report server, and now you can go look at your report. Once it has delpoyed, go to your reports landing page, which will 
have the same domain as report server, with the exception that you will go here ... http://localhost/reports. You should 
now see something like the following:

And when I click on the folder I should see the report I just created. And when I click the report name, I should see the 
interactive page for the report:
