Okay, first thing's first: you are not going to be able to do any of the stuff below unless you have Microsoft SQL 
Server Data Tools installed in your edition of Visiual Studio. If you have Visual Studio 2013, you may follow this 
link and install the package. Go ahead. I'll wait.

<p />
Now that we have that out of the way, fire up Visual Studio, click the File menu, and select New Project, and then click 
on the Business Intelligence item. You should see the following:

<p />
Once there, select Report Server Project, name it, and save it to the directory of your choosing. Once you are done with 
that, you should see the following on the RHS of the screen:
<p />

<p />
Now all we have to do is create a report. We will do this by simply using the report wizard. This is going to be very 
vanilla, so you should have no trouble folllowing along here. Right click on the Reports folder under your project and 
select Add and then New Item. You should see the following:
<p />

In the name field, sname your report whatever you like. I will call mine SampleTestReport. Once you have it named, 
click the Add button.
