Now that we have defined the report, we need to configure the parameters so that we can make 
the report interactive and provide values for them. The easiest part of this is providing fields for 
the dates. On the left side of Visual Studio, you should see the Report Data window. If you do not, 
select the View menu and Click on Report Data, which should be toward the very bottom. Why Microsoft 
did not make this a subentry in the Other Windows menu, I have no idea. Once you have the Report Data 
window up, expland the Parameters folder. You will see something like this (depends on the names and 
number of parameters you have in your example):
<p />

<p />
From here on out, I am going to simply illustrate what I am doing and not generalize this discussion to 
what you are doing as well. Having said that, I will right click on the beginData parameter and select 
properties. This gives me the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/DateParam.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Here, I will select the Data Type dropdown and select <i>Date/Time</i>. That's it. That's all I have to do. 
This is enough to have the report present a date-select dialog on the reports website. Doing this for the 
endData parameter, I will now focus my attention on the mainCategory parameter. Before I can do anything with 
this parameter, though, I need to supply values for it. Since my values are going to come from the database, 
I need to provide a dataset. I can do this by right-clicking on the Datasets folder and selecting Add Dataset. 
This gives me the the following dialog:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/NewDataSet.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Here, I will name my dataset MainCategoryDS and then select <i>Use a dataset embedded in my report</i>. This
will change the dialog to accommodate having to configure an additional, supporting dataset for the report. 
I will select the default data source from the asscociated dropdown and then click the Text radio button 
and type in the query I need to hydrate the dataset. After all that, this is what my dialog looks like:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/ConfigDataset.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Once the dataset has been created, I can return to my mainCategory parameter and configure it: I will right 
click on the parameter and select properties. I will then set the Data Type to Integer. Now, I need to tell it 
where to get its values from. Do do this, I select Available Values on the left hand side of the dialog, then 
select the <i>Get values from query</i> radio button. Once I do this, I can select the dataset I just created, 
then identify the value and label fields. Here is what the dialog now looks like:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/ConfigMainParam.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Having finished providing values for this parameter, we need to set up the final parameter, the subCategory. 
Again, we will define a dataset, but the values in this dataset are going to depend upon the value of the id 
assigned to the mainCategory parameter. Let's set this up by once again adding a dataset. Again, I will tell 
the dialog to use a dataset embedded in my report, I will select my default datasource, and I will specify Text 
and type in the query. The dialog now looks like the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/ConfigSubParameter.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Now, since I have a parameter in this query that I need to provide a value for, I will bind that parameter to the 
value assigned to mainCategory. To do this, I click on the Parameters menu item on the left hand side of the 
still-open dialog. One the right-hand side of the screen there is a drop down. In there, I can select the value 
assigned to mainCategory. Once done, my dialog looks like the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSWithParams/SetCascadingParamInDataset.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Once I do this, I can finally return to the parameter itself and set it up. The main part here, besides it having an 
integer value, is that, under Assigned Values, we point it to the dataset we just created. There is no difference 
between how this parameter is set up and how the previous one was. Now we should be ready to roll.
