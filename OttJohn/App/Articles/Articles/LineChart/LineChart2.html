As with the pie chart, we need to define a contract that will model the chart. With that in mind, here is what I came up with:
<p />
<pre>
function GetLineChart() {
    var LineChart = {
        GridUniqueId: "One",
        FontsAndText: GetChartFontsAndText(),
        DimsAndColor: GetChartDimsAndColor(),
        LineData: GetLineData()
    }
    return LineChart;
}
</pre>
<p />
This contract has only four parts to it:
<ul>
    <li>
        GridUniqueId: this is an id you will provide to uniquely identify your chart.
    </li>
    <li>
        FontsAndText: this is an object that will allow manipulation of the fonts and font colors associated with the chart.
    </li>
    <li>
        DimsAndColor: this is an object that will allow sizing and background color manipulation of the chart.
    </li>
    <li>
        LineData: this is an object that describes everything we need to know about the line in the chart.
    </li>
</ul>
<p />
The sub objects are defined in the following way:
<p />
<pre>
function GetChartFontsAndText() {

    var ChartFontsAndText = {

        Title: "Visits Over Past Week",                     //Defines the main title of the chart
        TitleFont: "14pt arial",                            //Font size for the title
        TitleColor: "black",                                //Font color for the title
        TicMarkFont: "8pt arial",                           //Font size for all other lablels
        TicMarkColor: "black"                               //Font color for all other labels

    }
    return ChartFontsAndText;
}
</pre>
<p />
<pre>
function GetChartDimsAndColor() {

    var ChartDimsAndColor = {

        CanvasHeight: 300,                                  //Height of the area in which the chart will reside (canvas)
        CanvasWidth: 800,                                   //Width of the area in which the chart will reside (canvas)
        GridBorderColor: "black",                           //Border color for canvas
        GridBorderThickness: "1",                           //Border thickness for canvas
        ChartBackColor: "#eeeeee",                          //Background color for the actual chart body
        GridTopLeftX: 40,                                   //Top left y-coordinate for the chart body
        GridTopLeftY: 20,                                   //Top left x-coordinate for the chart body
        VerticalTicCount: 3,                                //Number of horizontal grid lines for the chart body
        BottomChartOffset: 60                               //The amount of room to provide at the bottom of the chart for the title

    }
    return ChartDimsAndColor;
}
</pre>
<p />
<pre>
function GetLineData() {

    var LineData = {

        Color: "red",                                                                   //Line color
        LineWidth: 1,                                                                   //Line widths
        Data: new Array(1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 8, 2),                                           //Line values
        Labels: new Array('1-17', '1-18', '1-19', '1-12', '1-21', '1-22', '1-23')       //Associated labels

    }
    return LineData;
}
</pre>
<p />
Obviously, if you only have one chart, I guess you could hard-code all of your values here; mostly, though, I think you will probably want to 
populate this stuff on the server side based upon company themes and report descriptions. The only thing here that really should definitely 
come from the server are the Data and Label arrays.
