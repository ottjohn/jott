I've been reading over some of the testing materials for the JavaScript portion of the MCSD certification, and I got to revisit some 
of the drawing functionality that comes with HTML5. You know, I had so much fun with the pic charts (brought that warm, fuzzy math 
feeling back to me) that I decided to make a line chart too.
<p />
Now, before you complain and tell me there are all kinds of libraries out there that can do this for me, I am going to make the case 
that I'm studying for the Microsoft test, and, last time I checked, they didn't all an answer like, "Hey, I can get this in a third-party 
library, so I don't need to know this." Besides, it's good mental gymnastics, right?
<p />
Here's the scenario for this particular chart: I want it to track the number of visits I get to my website. Each hit will be logged and 
the previous seven days' worth of hits will be delivered to the client for presentation. Besides the data, the chart must be adaptive; that 
is to say, as the values on the y-axis ebb and flow, the the associated labels must expand and contract accordingly. Also, I want to be 
able to define the number of horizontal rules that move across the chart area, the font-size of all of the labels, the color of the 
labels, the color of the chart background, the color of the line, and, finally, I want the labels going across the bottom of the chart 
to be placed automaticaly, along with tick marks.

Ready? Let's go.
