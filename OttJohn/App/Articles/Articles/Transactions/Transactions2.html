Let's say you have a collection of really simple things that you need to insert into the database. For 
instance, let's say you have a list of nightly drops you need to add to a deposit table. In the scenario, 
the user selects the drops she wants to include in the deposit, and then clicks some button called 
Create Deposit. In this scenario, we may want the drops to behave as a tightly-bound unit; that is, if 
one of the drops does not make it into the deposit, then none of the drops will. 
<p />
I have seen example code that looks something like this:
<p />
<pre>
    using (ReportsDataDataContext Context = new ReportsDataDataContext())
    {
        int ILen = Drops.OpenDrops.Count;
        for (int i = 0; i < ILen; i++)
        {
            try 
            {
                Context.CloseDropItems(DepositId, DropId, Variance, VarianceReason);
            }
            catch(Exception Ex) 
            {
                //Log the error here
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p />
Now, there is noting wrong with this under two scenarios: one, there is only one drop per deposit; or, 
two, every mechanism surrouding this whole process is guaranteed to run with no errors and no network failures. 
Unlikely huh? There is only one little thing missing, and it's really easy to add: TransactionScope. You'll 
find TransactionScope under the System.Transactions namespace. Now, let's rewrite this little piece so we 
can make this collection all or none in behavior:
<p />
<pre>
    var HasErrors = false;
    using (ReportsDataDataContext Context = new ReportsDataDataContext())
    {
        using (var Transaction = new TransactionScope())
        {
            int ILen = Drops.OpenDrops.Count;
            try 
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < ILen; i++)
                {
                    int? RetVal = null;
                    Context.CloseDropItems(DepositId, DropId, Variance, VarianceReason, ref RetVal);
                    int DropId = RetVal.Value;
                    if (DropId == 0)
                    {
                        HasErrors = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }            
            }
            catch(Exception Ex) 
            {
                HasErrors = true;
                //Log the error here
            }
            finally 
            {
                if(!HasErrors) Transaction.Complete;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p />
As you can see from the really simple example above, this is very easy to implement, so there is no reason not 
to. Start by creating a boolean value that assumes everything is going to work out (I called mine <i>HasErrors</i>), 
create your transaction object, then, as you loop through your inserts, check for an error. If something goes wrong, 
set the boolean value accordingly, break out of the loop, and do not commit the transaction. Simple as that!
