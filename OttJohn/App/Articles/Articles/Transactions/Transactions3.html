Okay, so we've seen an instance in which the data layer itself needs to implement a transaction scope, but 
what about within TSQL? You will be happy to know that this is just as simple! Here, though, we have a 
little different scenario: instead of just blindly looping through inserts from the data layer, here we have 
disparate actions being taken against the database that, again, need to be treated as an all-or-none unit. 
For instance, say we are working with the aforementioned drops, and with each drop that is associated with 
a deposit, we have to perhaps add and entry into a variance table. So we might have something like the 
following (remember, this is contrived):
<p />
<pre>
    declare @DepositedDropId int = 0

    insert into

        DepositedDrops

    values (

        @DropId,
        @DropAmount,
        @DepositId,
        GetDate()

    )

    set @DepositedDropId = @@Identity

    if @DropVariance != 0
    begin

        insert into

            DropVarinace

        values (

            @DropId,
            @DropVariance,
            @DropVarianceReason

        )

    end
</pre>
<p />
Again, this is great under two circumstances: one, there is never a variance; two, nothing ever goes wrong with the data or surrounding 
infrastructure. Like that's going to happen. Let's fix this with TSQL Transactions:
<p />
<pre>
    declare @DepositedDropId int = 0
    declare @DrpError = 0

    begin transaction
    begin try

        insert into

            DepositedDrops

        values (

            @DropId,
            @DropAmount,
            @DepositId,
            GetDate()

        )

        set @DepositedDropId = @@Identity

        if @DropVariance != 0
        begin

            insert into

                DropVarinace

            values (

                @DropId,
                @DropVariance,
                @DropVarianceReason

            )

        end

    end try
    begin catch

        set @DropError = 1

    end catch

    if @DropError = 0
    begin

        commit trans

    end
    else
    begin

        rollback trans

    end

</pre>
<p />
Again, this is very simple. We add a structure to the code for safety and we are protected. Under the former example, say 
the insert into the DepositedDrops table went fine but that there was an error inserting values into the DropVariance 
table. In this case, we would lose the variance information. It would be better to simply back everything out and report an error. 
Under the second example, however, we use a transaction, and, in the event there is an error, we don't have to worry about 
losing information; rather, we rollback the transaction and it's like the processing never happened.
