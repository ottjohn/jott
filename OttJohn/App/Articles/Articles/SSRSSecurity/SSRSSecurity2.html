Okay, so here's the deal, when you build your reports, they might not be just simple little things that 
can be described with a single, simple querty or a query that relies on a few parameters that are simple 
and user-supplied. In fact, most of the time, your reports are going to be generated by complex stored 
procedures that might, in turn fire off other stored procedures and functions, and might have parameters 
that themsleves have values that must be populated by parameterized queries and stored procedures. In this 
case, you are going to have to set an execution account for your report server (unless you want to give 
all of your reporting users account access to SQL Server that will allow execution of scripts. Probably not 
a good idea). With this in mind, go to your Start menu, click on your version of SQL Server (mine is 2008 R2 
so what follows may be a bit different than what you see), open up the Configuration Tools folder, then 
select <i>Reporting Services Configuration Manager</i>. You should see something like this:

<p />
Once the dialog opens you will be asked to select a SQL Server to connect to. Select one, and then click OK. 
Once you are in, you can browse the menu items on the left-hand side of the dialog. Briefly, I will go through 
some of these.

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Service Account</b>: this is the account under which SSRS runs. I have this on my laptop, so Local 
        system is sufficient. It does not need to move across networks, and Service Account has more than enough 
        priveledge for anything I need to do with SSRS on a laptop. If you are running SSRS on a server and the 
        database is on another server, you may want to think about a special domain account to run this service.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Web Service URL</b>: this is where you will deploy your reports. This is NOT where you surf to get 
        to your reports.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Report Manager URL</b>: this is where you surf to for viewing your reports. 
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Execution Account</b>: This is what we are talking about in this section. This is the account that you 
        can use on behalf of the report server to run queries that require an elevated security level. In this case, 
        if the server is on a domain, I would recommend a domain account that has a password that DOES NOT need to be 
        reset and an account setting that has just enough provelege to run what you need it to run against any 
        reports you create.
    </li>
</ol>
