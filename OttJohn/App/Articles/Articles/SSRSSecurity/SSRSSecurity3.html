Now there are two places that we need to add users when thinking about report browsing: to SSRS and to 
the databases in SQL Server. Let's take care of teh web side first. Go to your SSRS reports landing page 
by typing in http://localhost/reports in the location field of a browser on the server that runs SSRS as a 
service. You should now see the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSSecurity/ReportsHome.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Once here, click on the Folder Settings icon. This will bring up the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSSecurity/HomeSecurity.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Now click on teh New Role Assignment icon at the top of the screen. You will see the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSSecurity/NewRole.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Here, simply add the group or suer name in the text field provided. This will be the name of a group or 
a user that exists on the machine or in the domain the machine is connected to. Once you've done this, 
select the check boxes that describes who this user or group is. If they are to only browse the reports, 
then that is the only item you should check. If they are to use the web tools to actually create reports, 
then check the appropriate boxes. Once you have the user or group configured, click the OK button. The 
web page will return to the security page and your new user or group will be listed. 
<p />
You are now ready to add the user or group to SQL Server.
