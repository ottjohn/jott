Occassionally, you will be cruising along and think you have all of your bases covered, and then one of 
your users claims he can't get in to review a report. In fact, after providing credentionals, nothing at 
all shows up in that person's browser. This, of course, sucks big time. So now you have to go to 
Google and look for similar circumstances, find several, and then hope you can find the one that applies 
to your dilemma quickly. Well, in my case, it was quick.

SSRS has a configuration file, but it does not belong to your project. It belongs to to the directory under 
which SSRS runs. In my case, this is 
<p />
<pre>
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer
</pre>
<p />
The name of the file is rsreportserver.config. When the browser tries to connect to SSRS, there are two 
protocols that can be used: kerberos and NTLM. In my case, the communication was defaulting to 
kerberos when it should have been NTLM. There are two tags that correspond to these protocals, their names 
are RSWindowsNegotiate and RSWindowsNTLM, respectively. To remove kerberos as a protocol, either remove 
the tag or comment it out. Then save the config file, restart the SRSS service, and you should be good to go.
