Now that we have the web site security taken care of, we can take care of the associated SQL Server side of 
security. With this in mind, fire up SQL Server (the ones that contain the database(s) against which your 
reporting server works). Once there, open up the security tab under the Object Explorer window:
<p />

<p />
Right click on Logins, the select New Login. Once there, add the same user or group that you added to the web side. 
Your dialog, then, should look something like this:
<p />
<img src="App/Articles/Articles/SSRSSecurity/SQLServerNewLogin.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Now that you have a new user or group login, you need to associate that entity with databases and assign 
permissions. To do this, click on the User Mapping menu item on the left-hand side of the dialog. Once 
there, select the database that the report server runs against. You should see something like the following:
<p />

<p />
Here, you will notice that I have both public and db_owner. The role of db_owner really should be frowned 
upon when assigning such permissions to a user or a group. In my case, I have a report that uses a stored 
procure, which, in turn, requires execute permission. If your reports are generated from parameterized 
text-based queries, I do not think you will need to do this. Beyond that, this is all you have to do. Your 
user can now get to the report ... with perhaps one minor exception.
