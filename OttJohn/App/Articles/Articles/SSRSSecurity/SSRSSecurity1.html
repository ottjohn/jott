Besides installing SSRS, perhaps the most frustraing thing for first-time users is getting the security 
settings right so people can actually use your reports! I for one have found this a real pain in the ass. 
This articles should be fairly short, but it may keep you out of some of the messes I had to drive through.

As with most of my articles, this one was bourne out of a request to slowly move reports that now exist 
under MS Access to a web-based system. I quickly reviewed a few non-Microsoft solutions and quickly dismissed 
them in favor of SSRS. Basically, in my opinion, it would be short of smart to discount something that's 
free, powerful, and already integrated into your server.

The first thing we will look into is the SSRS Reporting Services Configuration Manager. Then we will add 
people to SQL Server and the reporting server, and then we will take a look at one Gotcha. Let's go!
