Now that we have IIS set up to use a particular user account, and now that we have added and configured that account to some extent 
in SQL Server, we are ready to move forward. The first thing we need to do is change our connection string:
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;add name="ConnectionStringName" connectionstring="Data Source=[Server Name];Initial Catalog=[Database Name];
         Trusted_Connection=true" providername="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Also, you should now have an entry under sytem.web that looks like this:
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;identity impersonate="true" /&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Compile your application and test it out. This was not so hard, was it? Now all you have to do is keep track of all of the users 
you're using for this between your dev, test, and production environments. Before we let this go, though, a few notes:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>
        The data source in my example is simply dev01. This is because my SQL Server is on the same domain as IIS. In this case, 
        the system is using something called named pipes to get around. 
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your SQL Server is on a different domain, then you need to change the data source to an IP followed by the applicable 
        port number. Most SQL Servers run off from port 1433, so a typical entry here would look like XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, 1433.
        <p />
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you have to use an IP in your connection string, then there’s one other thing that you need to do: you need to make 
                certain that the TCP/IP protocol is enabled. You can do this by opening up SSCM and going through the Client Protocols 
                nodes to ensure that this feature is enabled (see below). 
                <p />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If your SQL Server is on a different domain, then, obviously, you cannot use a single domain user to manage both IIS and the SQL Server. 
        This is okay. Simply ensure that the user name and password for the user is the same on both machines and you should have no problems. 
    </li>
</ol>
<p />
Ensuring TCP/IP is enabled in SQL Server. You need to open up SQL Server Configuration Manager. Once there expand all of the nodes to find the 
protocol feature. To enable a certain protocol, simply double click it. That will present a dialog to turn the feature on or off.
