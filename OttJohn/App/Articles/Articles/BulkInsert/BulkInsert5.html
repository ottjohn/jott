The format file is probably the hardest part here. I will give you the meat of the stored procedure 
and explain what I think needs explaining:
<p />
<pre>
    set @RetVal = ''
	begin try
	
		declare @bcpCommand varChar(512)
		set @bcpCommand =	'bcp.exe WcriMembership.dbo.CricketCredits in ' + 
							@FilePath + ' -T -f ' +  @FileFormat
					
		exec xp_cmdShell @bcpCommand
	
	end try
	begin catch
	
		set @RetVal = 'Batch upload failed'

	end catch
</pre>
<p />
Here, we are doing a BCP from within SSMS. Again, we specify the full path to the table, and the stored procedure itself 
is passed the full paths for the file to insert and the format file. Again, the -T refers to trusted connection, and the 
-f tells the BCP command to use the format file that follows it. Once the command is generated, it is executed, and 
the table should be updated. 
<p />
What if you want to use bulk insert? Even simpler, but with a twist. Here is the command:
<p />
<pre>
    BULK INSERT WcriMembership.dbo.CricketCredits
    FROM @FilePath
    WITH 
      (
        DATAFILETYPE = 'char',
        FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '\r\n',
        FORMATFILE = @FileFormat
      );
</pre>
<p />
When I originally ran this, it didn't work. It said some nonesense about the version of the format file being wrong. The 
BCP command reported version 11. As it turns out, the versions of SQL Server on my laptop versus that on the development 
server are different enough that I had to decrement the version in the format file (the very first line) to 10.0. Odd since 
both servers are SQL Server 8 R2.
