Okay, so most of my posts in here, obviously, are going to come from what I need to do in my day-to-day work. 
A lot of what I do is driven by weird requests driven by an underserved industry. Case in point, a guy I work 
with has to process a whole bunch of credits (thousands) against phone sales about once every two weeks. 
Anyway, these lists come via email. He works through the email by hand. He is unhappy. Very unhappy. He 
asked me if I could help you, so I told him I'd see what I could do.

This is the problem with this industry (small-time phone players): nobody is connected. They have swivel-chair 
processing to the point they could seat and audience of hundreds! I don't know why this is so. Maybe it's a 
lack of resources. Maybe it's laziness. Maybe its just plain old ignornace. I can't tell you, but I can show 
you my solution, a solution that allowed my friend to once again visit his family.

From the title of this docuemnt, you probably already surmised that I am going to use SQL Server's bulk insert. 
I am not going to stop there, though. I am also going to talk about BCP and format files. This should be a short 
ride, but it should also be an informative one. Let's go.
