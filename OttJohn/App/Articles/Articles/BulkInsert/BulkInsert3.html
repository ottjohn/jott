Whether we are using BCP or bulk insert, we still have to make the contents of the file fit our schema. Now, if 
the file itself had everything it needed to create a primary key, and had all of the fields in the table we want 
to populate, we'd be good to go. But it does not. Let's say, for argument's sake, we have an identity field and two 
other fields that are not covered in the file. What do we do? Well, we are going to make a format file, that's what. 
How do I make a format file, you ask? Easily. The following is a BCP command that you can run either from the command 
prompt or within SSMS to create one. For this case, I am going to run it from within SSMS:
<p />
<pre>
    exec xp_cmdShell 'bcp [FULL_PATH_TO_TABLE] format nul -f [LOCATION_OF_YOUR_FILE] -c -T'
</pre>
<p />
I will cover some of the parameters in the command, and then also cover an error that is probably going to occur when 
you run this on your machine:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>
        FULL_PATH_TO_TABLE: basically, [DatabaseName].[dbo].[TableName]
    </li>
    <li>
        LOCATION_OF_YOUR_FILE: Full path, including drive letter
    </li>
    <li>
        -c: The format of the file is in characters and not Xxml
    </li>
    <li>
        -T: The connection with the server is trusted. If you do not use this, then you are going to have to use the 
        -U and -P parameters (user name and password).
    </li>
    <li>
        -f: BCP command is to generate a format file
    </li>
</ol>
<p />
Once you do this and try to run it (inside of SSMS), it will probably fail. That is because by default access to the 
command shell has been denied. You have to switch these privileges on. Here is how to do that:
<p />
<pre>
    -- To allow advanced options to be changed.
    EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
    GO
    -- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
    -- To enable the feature.
    EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
    GO
    -- To update the currently configured value for this feature.
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
</pre>
If you are going to do this on a server at work, make sure you have permission from your mother first. Once you've done this, 
you should be able to generate your format file. Problem is, we still have to edit it. We'll do that next.
