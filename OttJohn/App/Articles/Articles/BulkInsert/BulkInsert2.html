Basically, to use Bulk Insert you need a file. The problem is, the third-party that sends the file probably 
does not have it formatted in a very useful way. What to do? Reformat it, of course! Below is the code I used 
to reformat the document, including comments illustrating what's going on:
<p />
<pre>
    string FilePathNew = "";
    FileContents = FileContents.Replace("$", "");           //The dollar sign was given its own row. Right? Are you kidding me?
    FileContents = FileContents.Replace("\r\n", "$");       //To preserve the whitespace that is \r\n, I replaced it wtih $
    Regex Reg = new Regex("\\s{2,}");                       //
    FileContents = Reg.Replace(FileContents, ",");          //I replaced all fo the whitespace with width with a comma
    Reg = new Regex("\\${1,}");                             //
    FileContents = Reg.Replace(FileContents, "\r\n");       //I re-inserted the \r\n by replacing the dollar sign with it
    try
    {
        FilePathNew = FilePath.Replace(".txt", "Conv.txt"); 
        File.WriteAllText(FilePathNew, FileContents);       //Saved the file to disk
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
    }
    return FilePathNew;
</pre>
<p />
The point of the massaging of the file is that you can use the code to make something that looks like this ...
<p />
    <img src="App/Articles/Articles/BulkINsert/MessyFile.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Look like this ...
<p />
    <img src="App/Articles/Articles/BulkINsert/CSV.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Okay, so we've taken an almost useless file and massaged it so that it is standard CSV, which we can now use with SQL Server. 
Now we need to hop over to the SQL Server side and see what kind of constraints we have waiting for us there.
