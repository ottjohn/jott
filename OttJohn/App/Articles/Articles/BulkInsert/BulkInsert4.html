Once you run the BCP command to create your format file, you still need to edit it. See, the format file will have 
all the information to describe the contents of the table. But as we are going to use this file to map elements from 
the CSV to the table by position, we cannot have all of these elements. Here is what my original format file looked 
like:
<p />
<pre>
    11.0
    8
    1       SQLCHAR             0       12      "\t"     1     id               ""
    2       SQLCHAR             0       256     "\t"     2     Description      SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    3       SQLCHAR             0       15      "\t"     3     IMEI             SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    4       SQLCHAR             0       24      "\t"     4     SalesDate        ""
    5       SQLCHAR             0       10      "\t"     5     StoreId          SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    6       SQLCHAR             0       30      "\t"     6     CreditDue        ""
    7       SQLCHAR             0       24      "\t"     7     DateAdded        ""
    8       SQLCHAR             0       30      "\r\n"   8     Variance         ""
</pre>
<p />
But we do not need the first, seventh, or eigth fields. We can then remove them. We also notice that the column 
delimers are incorrect. They should be commas. We can fix that, too. Here is what we have so far, then:
<p />
<pre>
    11.0
    8
    2       SQLCHAR             0       256     ","     2     Description      SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    3       SQLCHAR             0       15      ","     3     IMEI             SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    4       SQLCHAR             0       24      ","     4     SalesDate        ""
    5       SQLCHAR             0       10      ","     5     StoreId          SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    6       SQLCHAR             0       30      ","     6     CreditDue        ""
</pre>
Almost done. But we missed something. We replaced the end-of-row delimiter with a comma, so we 
need to replace that once again with a carriage return line feed:
<p />
<pre>
    11.0
    8
    1       SQLCHAR             0       256     ","     2     Description      SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    2       SQLCHAR             0       15      ","     3     IMEI             SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    3       SQLCHAR             0       24      ","     4     SalesDate        ""
    4       SQLCHAR             0       10      ","     5     StoreId          SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
    5       SQLCHAR             0       30      "\r\n"     6     CreditDue        ""
</pre>
<p />
Now we are ready to rock. Now we can go into SQL server and build a stored procedure that will insert everything 
in the file to a particular table.
