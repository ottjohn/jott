                            I have split my time over the past twenty or so years between teaching and professional programming. For the past eight years, 
                            I have focused mainly on programming, centered on Single Page Application Web Development. While I can code on any layer, 
                            I'm happiest when I'm spreading myself over the full stack. Currently, I'm working at a very small shop where I'm building 
                            scalable apps that manage business processes, including member management, reporting, and business asset management.
                            <p />
                            Presently, my solutions are built around the following languages and technologies: SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Reporting Services, MVC, AngularJS, 
                            JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, Web API, WCF for some external callers and internal applications, TSQL, LinqToSQL, Stored Procedures, MS Unit Testing, 
                            Membership Services, Forms Authentication, IIS,  and, of course, C#, some VB.NET, and some VBScript. Occassionally, I still dabble in the postback 
                            world, I sometimes also find myself working on Windows Forms, MS Access code, and Windows Services. 
                            <p />
                            I like working in small, fairly informal shops. I think it's because it gives me an opportunity to wear a lot of hats and the ability to 
                            exercise a lot of skills. Since I started programming, I have been a part of three start-ups and two shops that had a start-up feel. I think 
                            that smaller companies offer interesting challenges that routinely require me to think outside of the box (sometimes way outside). Life isn't 
                            all about blindly building out adapters for third-party services and translating what you get into a native format so you can run with it, so to speak. 
                            A lot of it is, but I actually find myself enjoying (even though I complain about it) creating off-the-wall solutions to adapt to providers who apparently 
                            have no idea what a web service is, much less an API. It can be frustrating for sure, but it's also fun!
                            <p />
                            Besides programming, I absolutely love to teach. It's one of those careers in which you can have unequivocol impact on people and actually 
                            get paid too. In the past I have taught Mathematics, Writing, and Programming courses. The highlight of my teaching career came 
                            when I developed a two-year web programming curriculum and actually got a chance to teach it at a community college. While the venue for the 
                            curriculum might not have been the best (Sioux City, Iowa), it was a success for a little more than three years. It's nice to know 
                            that I have former students out there who are making just as much as I am on just two years of college education delivered by a program I developed! 
                            Although I don't teach now, when time permits, I like to find adjunct positions at local community colleges so I can keep those skills 
                            fresh and continue to have impact on people.

                            A small bit of text about this site:

                            <ul>

                                    If you want to leave any comments regarding any of my articles, you can do so by registering and logging in. Otherwise, 
                                    they are simply there for you to read.
                                </li>

                                    I understand there are some errors on this site. I am working to get those taken care of. There's only so much time during the day.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Some things might appear incomplete. That's because they are. For instance, the paging in the Article section does not work yet.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I would like to ad a section that demonstrates some of the tools I have built. It would flesh out this site as a vehicle for a 
                                    portfolio. This might take some time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I would also like to put in a section in which developers can add interview questions categorized by most of the same categories 
                                    under my Articles section. This, too, will take some time.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
