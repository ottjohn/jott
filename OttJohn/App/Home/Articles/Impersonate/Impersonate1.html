Sometimes, you've done something for so long that it just becomes ingrained in you, and you ignore the procedure and blindly go about your 
business without thinking about the possible risk associated with what you're doing. One of the things that I've done for quite some time 
is you the sys admin password for SQL Server as my credential for my connection string when hitting a database. Actualy, lot's of people do 
this. There are two things wrong with this:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>You are using an admin account on SQL Server on behalf of a client you really do not want to have admin privileges</li>
    <li>You are also more than likely littering your config file with the credentials of said sa account, which you probably do not want your devs to have</li>
</ol>
<p />
Okay, so you got lazy. But what should you do? Well, you need to create an account on your domain (or the machine) that has reduced privileges 
on your SQL Server but still have enough privileges to run what needs to be run to accomplish the tasks you need to accomplish. Beyond the scope of 
this document is building that SQL Server account. Get your database admin to do it, or wait for a follow-up article on this. In scope is the use 
of the account so that we may use a trusted connection with our connection strings. 
<p />
Now, if you do not have a domain or computer user built into SQL Server with reduced privileges, fear not. Just use your account. Impersonating a 
user in a web application is half the battle. Once this is accomplished, all that is left is to whittle down the account in SQL Server so that it 
is no longer all-capable and knowing.
