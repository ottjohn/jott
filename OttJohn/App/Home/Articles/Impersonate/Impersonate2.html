This whole exercise is going to assume that you already have a web application running under IIS. If you do not, to follow along, 
you really should make one that does something with the database; otherwise, you are going to be simply reading and not doing. With 
that in mind, here is what you need to do to get this process going:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Open IIS</li>
    <li>Find and click on your application name</li>
    <li>In the main pain at the very bottom, select the Features tab (you are probably aready on it)</li>
    <li>Under the IIS group, select the Authentication icon</li>
</ol>
Once you've done this, the main panel will change to illustrate how your current authentication scheme is working. It will probably say 
that your authentication is anonymous. And this is perfectly okay if you want to continue to use the sa password in your connection 
string ... or if you want to add the anonymous IIS account to SQL Server and give it permission to do what it needs to do in the 
database. But we don't want to continue on this way. We're tired of it. We should be wearing a scarlet SA. Oh the shame. 
<p />
So let's change everything now ...
<p />
<ol>
    <li>
        Right click on Anonymous Authentication and select Edit. This will bring up a dialog
    </li>
    <li>
        Under Anonymous User Identity click the Specify User radio button; the Click the Set button
    </li>
    <li>
        In the newly-presented dialog, enter the credentials of the account you want to impersonate
    </li>
</ol>
Last, one you close the dialogs, enable impersonation. This will add an item to your web config file under your application. We will take a look at that 
modification later in this document. Why did we replace the built-in user? If we are working on a domain and the SQL Server is on a different machine than IIS, 
then we need to leverage a user that exists on the domain and has the requisite privileges on both machines to run the IIS application and the SQL Server. 
In this case, using the App Pool identity on one machine and then trying to access the SQL Server on another machine in the domain with those same creds just 
won’t work. In this case, you must have a domain user account. You can call it whatever you want.
<p />
Next, we need to add the user to SQL Server. Open up SSMS, drill down to the Security/Logins tab. Right click on Logins and select New Login from the context menu. 
This will bring up a dialog in which you can add and configure the user. Do the following:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Under Login name, type in the user name you added to IIS. Enter it in the form domain\username</li>
    <li>Ensure that Windows Authentication is selected</li>
    <li>Click on Server Roles in the Select a Page feature on the left. Here, ensure that Public is selected</li>
    <li>Now click on User Mapping in the menu on the left. This will bring up another dialog</li>
</ol>
<p />
In the new dialog, select the databases you want the user to have access to. With respect to specific permissions, in addition to Public, select datareader and datawriter. 
Now you can close out of the security feature. Note: selecting datareader and datawriter should give you sufficient privileges if your user is going to execute scripts 
against the database. This does not cover execution of stored procedures. To do this, you need to do one more thing: Open up a query window in SQL Server. In the window, 
type the following:
<p />
<pre>
    use [Database Name]
    go
    grant execute to [UserName]
</pre>
<p />
