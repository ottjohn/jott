Okay, here's a problem that I hope you are never unfortunate enough to come across. Before I get into it's solution, let me give you 
some background: I work in a really small shop, and the skills here with respect to coding were very limited before I came along. 
That means that solutions, although they work, are archaic and generally unsettling. The primary architecture in this shop is an 
Access application built over SQL Server 2008 all delivered by Terminal Services Client. 
<p />
When it is time to integrate external, third-party providers, such as a payment system, then, the task can be a little daunting and 
frustrating. Making a .NET-based adapter for that third-party service work with an application fueled by VBScript is not in the least 
bit fun. Believe me. I've been there and done that. This time, however, I decided to come at it from a different angle.
<p />
As I thought about the problem, I remembered that I had once fired off a service call from SQL Server 2005. Just for the hell of it. 
Because there is no practical benefit to firing off a service call from SQL Server in the first place, right? Well, as it turns out, 
I guess there is some practicality to it. Especially if you have disparate systems working with the same problem, and you can use 
that service as a hand off.
<p />
When I had first fired off the call years ago, it was to an old ASMX service. Converting your WCF to this type of service will be 
one of the things that will have to be covered. So if you are interested in how to do this, please read on.
