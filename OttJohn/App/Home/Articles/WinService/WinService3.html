Now we have a configuration file and a logger. Notice that the logger name is contained in the configuration file, so we need to 
extract that information before we can do anything with it. Let's do that now:
<p />
<pre>
    public string GetConfigValue(string Key)
    {
        string ConfigValue = "";
        try
        {
            string LocationApp = new Uri(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly( ).CodeBase).AbsolutePath;
            System.Configuration.Configuration AppConfig = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(LocationApp);
            ConfigValue = AppConfig.AppSettings.Settings[Key].Value;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            if (EventLogActive) eventLog1.WriteEntry("Cannot find configuration value for " + Key);
        }
        return ConfigValue;
    }
</pre>
<p />
The first two lines simply get the location of the configuration file and open it. The second couple of lines simply check the 
key and retrieve the appropriate value. Okay, so this part is now available and ready to use when we need it. Note that to make 
use of this code, you will have to use the Reflection assembly.
<p />
Now let’s go ahead and make sure our logger is ready to use. I am going to do this by creating a method called CheckForLogger. 
I define it in the following way:
<p />
<pre>
    private void CheckForLogger()
    {
        EventLogActive = false;
        string EventLoggerState = GetConfigValue("EventLogging").ToLower();
        if (EventLoggerState != "" && EventLoggerState == "on")
        {
            EventLogActive = true;
            string LoggerSource = GetConfigValue("LogSource");
            string LoggerName = GetConfigValue("LogName");
            if (!System.Diagnostics.EventLog.SourceExists(LoggerSource))
            {
                System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource(LoggerSource, LoggerName);
            }
            eventLog1.Source = LoggerSource;
            eventLog1.Log = LoggerName;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p />
Here, we check the configuration file to determine if we want the logger to run. If we do, then we will set event logging to active (EventLogActive 
needs to be global) and then get the source and the name for the event log to write to. This simply configures the event logger to write to a specific log.
