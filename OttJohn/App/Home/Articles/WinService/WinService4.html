Now that we can read our configuration file and log stuff, we can actually thinking about doing something with the service. Let's 
build in a Timer and configure it to fire. To do this, you will need to reference System.Timers and then create a private, global timer 
object. Call it whatever you like. I called mine MemberReconcileTimer. Now let’s configure our timer. We can do this by checking the 
configuration file for the interval we want, and then we need to name the handler that will be executed each time the timer is fired. 
I cleverly called this method StartTimer: 
<p />
<pre>
    private void StartTimer()
    {
        int IntervalInMinutes = Convert.ToInt32(GetConfigValue("CheckInterval"));
        MemberReconcileTimer = new Timer();
        MemberReconcileTimer.Interval = IntervalInMinutes * 60 * 1000;
        MemberReconcileTimer.Elapsed += new 
            ElapsedEventHandler(OnMemberReconcileExecute);
        MemberReconcileTimer.Enabled = true;
    }
</pre>
<p />
The code here should be obvious: I snag the interval at which I want to fire, which I have in minutes, I instantiate the timer, I set 
its interval, I add a event handler of my definition to execute whatever needs to happen whenever it fires, and then I enable it. Simple 
as that. Now let's take a look at the handler:
<p />
<pre>
    private void OnMemberReconcileExecute(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        DateTime CurrentDateTime = DateTime.Now;
        int CurrentHour = CurrentDateTime.Hour;
        if (CurrentHour == AlwaysSendListAt)
        {
            string RetMessage = "";
            try
            {
                    MaintService.MaintenanceServiceClient Service = new MaintService.MaintenanceServiceClient();
                    RetMessage = Service.MembershipMerge();
                    Service.Close();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                eventLog1.WriteEntry(ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p />
Since my needs are very simple, all I have to do is compare the current hour with the variable AlwaysSendListAt, which I have tucked in 
my configuration file and which is now a global variable. If they are the same, then I call a web service that will happily do my bidding. 
As for the service itself, covering that is beyond the scope of this document. Afterall, you could be doing anything here, including calling 
your own libraries or just tucking in code within the service itself to do some executing. The only real coding left for you to consider 
are two basic methods:
<p />
<pre>
    protected override void OnStop()
    {
        if (EventLogActive) eventLog1.WriteEntry("Member reconciliation component offline");
    }
</pre>
<p />
Here, we simply log an event to record that the component has been stopped. As for the OnStart method, we have the following:
<p />
<pre>
    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        SetInterval = Convert.ToDouble(GetConfigValue("ThreshHold"));
        AlwaysSendListAt = Convert.ToInt32(GetConfigValue("AlwaysSendListAt"));
        CheckForLogger();
        StartTimer();
        if (EventLogActive) eventLog1.WriteEntry("Member reconciliation component online");
    }
</pre>
<p />
Here, you can see that all we are doing is populating global variables, calling the two methods we defined earlier, and recording in the event 
log that we have started our processing.
<p />
Probably think we're done, right? Probably think we can just fire this puppy up and go to town, huh? Nope. Not yet. We have to install the service;
then we can have a little party.
