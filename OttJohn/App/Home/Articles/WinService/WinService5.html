The final thing we need to do here is add the installer. We cannot run our service until it has been installed by registering it with the 
service control manager. There are a few steps here:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Right click on your service name, and select View Designer</li>
    <li>Right click on the designer surface and select Add Installer. This will create a new item in your project called ProjectInstaller</li>
    <li>Select the design view for ProjectInstaller</li>
    <li>Select the icon ServiceInstaller1 and then go to its associated properties box</li>
    <li>Here, ensure that the ServiceName property is set to your service name. Also, you can set the DisplayName and Description properties 
    here as well. Once you’ve done that, set the StartType property to Automatic if that is how you want the service to start</li>
</ol>
<p />
Once you’ve done this, click on the ServiceProcessInstaller1 icon, go to its property box, and set the Account property to LocalSystem. This is 
the account under which the process will run. The final step is to actually install the service. Here is what you want to do:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Copy a shortcut to the VS command console to the bin\debug directory</li>
    <li>Right click the command icon and run as administrator</li>
    <li>Change the directory to the current bin\debug directory</li>
    <li>Type the following command: installutil [name of executable]. In my case, it was installutil MemberReconciliation.exe</li>
    <li>If you are anything like me, you will wind up having to uninstall this thing about a thousand times during testing so you can fix errors. 
    To do this, add a /u right after the command</li>
</ol>
<p />
Now, you are ready to roll!
