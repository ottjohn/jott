To make a call to the authentication service using AJAX, you will need the following call in your script:
<p />
<pre>
    function Authenticate(DataToSend) {
        var responsePromise = $http({
            method: 'POST',
            url: 'OttjohnAuth.svc/Login',
            data: DataToSend,
            async: false,
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });
        return responsePromise;
    }
    function Logout() {
        var responsePromise = $http({
            method: 'POST',
            url: 'OttjohnAuth.svc/Logout',
            data: null,
            async: false,
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });
        return responsePromise;
    }
</pre>
<p />
This, of course, assumes that the service name is OttjohnAuth. To check authentication on the server side, you need the HttpContext object. This is 
going to be available for you under System.Web. Checking if a user is authenticated is simple:
<p />
<pre>
    HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated
</pre>
<p />
To check if a user in in a role, you can use the following:
<p />
<pre>
    HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("ROLENAME")
</pre>
<p />
That should be all there is to it. On a parting note, for examples like this, I will try to have fully working code for you to download.
