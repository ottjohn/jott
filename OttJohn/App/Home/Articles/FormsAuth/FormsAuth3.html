Okay, we are going down the road of Forms Authentication, and we have told our config file that we want to work with an authentication 
cookie. The best way I know how to do this is to put some code into a Global.asax file. If you do not have one in your project already, 
grab on and then open it up. Once you do, you are going to need to make two entries:
<p />
<pre>
        protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            System.Web.ApplicationServices.AuthenticationService.CreatingCookie
                += new EventHandler<system.web.applicationservices.creatingcookieeventargs>
                (AuthenticationService_CreatingCookie);
        }
</pre>
<p />
This registers a listener for cookie creation on Application Start. Now you can add the next entry to do what you will to build the 
cookie:
<p />
<pre>
        CustomerProcess CP = new CustomerProcess();
        string RolesString = CP.GetRolesOnLogin(e.UserName);
        FormsAuthenticationTicket ticket = new FormsAuthenticationTicket(1, e.UserName, DateTime.Now, DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30), false, RolesString, FormsAuthentication.FormsCookiePath);
        string encryptedCookie = FormsAuthentication.Encrypt(ticket);
        HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, encryptedCookie);
        HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Add(cookie);
        e.CookieIsSet = true;
</pre>
<p />
In my case, I have a library that has an object called CustomerProcess. CustomerProcess with grab the UserName of the user loggin in and 
grab all of the roles associated with that user. It will then create an authentication ticket and stuff it in a cookie. Now you have the Identity of 
the user populated in the HttpContext object. How do you grab the cookie, you ask? By doing the following:
<p />
<pre>
        HttpCookie AuthCookie = HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies.Get(".ASPXAUTH");
        FormsAuthenticationTicket AuthTicket = FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(AuthCookie.Value);
        request.UserInfo.UserRoles = AuthTicket.UserData;
        response.UserInfo = request.UserInfo;
</pre>
<p />
This is the code you need to call upon successful login. Once you know the user is in the system, you can fetch the cookie and get the 
roles. Do not change lines one and two. The request object in line three is mine. The RHS populates the roles object by getting the 
roles from the cookie (in the format I specified in the Global.asax file). I am using a request object here because it is available. It 
already has my UserInformation object there. In the end, I just dump that object into my reponse object and leave the method.
<p />
Now that we have that out of the way, let's set up a service that we can talk to using AJAX to log the user on and off.
