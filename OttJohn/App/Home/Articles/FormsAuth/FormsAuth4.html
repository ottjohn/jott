Okay, so we have a membership database in place, we've added some stuff to the web config file to make all of that work, and we've 
added stuff to the Global.asax file to create an authentication ticket. To get all of this ready to work with, the last think we need 
to add is an authentication web service and a reference to that service. I am sure you have experience adding a web service, so 
let's just go through the motions:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>
        Right click on your project and select Add, then New Item
    </li>
    <li>
        Under your chosen language, select Web and then scroll most of the way down to the bottom
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the plain WCF Service. Give it a decent name before clicking OK
    </li>
</ol>
<p />
Once you've done this, you need to change a couple of things with respect to the service itself. Go to the service and right click on the 
service name, and then select View Markup. You will want to replace what is there with the following:
<p />
<pre>
    Service="System.Web.ApplicationServices.AuthenticationService"
    CodeBehind="System.Web.ApplicationServices.ApplicationServicesHostFactory"
</pre>
<p />
Once you've done this, you will probably be asked if you want to allow changes to your config file. Allow the changes. Now that we have the service 
installed, let's make a reference to it. Before we can do this, we need the URL for the service. If you do not know how to get this, don't worry. All 
you have to do is right click on the service itself and select Browse With. A dialog box will appear asking you to select the browser you want to use. 
Ignore this and click browse. This will bring up a browser and the location field will have the URL of the service. 
<p />
Now, Since this is a service that will be consumed by an AJAX call and we are not implementing CORS here, in the same project, right click on the project 
name and select Add, then Service Reference. Once you've done this, paste the URL of the service into the Address field and click Go. You will see the 
dialog think for a bit and then it will return with a description of the service in the services list. Once the service has been added, give it a decent 
namespace (other than the cleverly-named default) and click Ok.
<p />
I know you are anxious to test this out, but there are some things we need to check in the config file. So let's make certain that everything is in order 
there.
<p />
First, check that authentication service is enabled. You can do this by searching for authenticationService in the config file. If it is not there, place 
the following right below your membership entry (this is not a part of system.web):
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;system.web.extensions&gt;
        &lt;scripting&gt;
        &lt;webservices&gt;
            &lt;authenticationservice enabled="true" requiressl="false" /&gt;
            &lt;/webservices&gt;
        &lt;/scripting&gt;
    &lt;/system.web.extensions&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Second, we need to configure some stuff to allow the service to work with JSON. Make sure you have the following under the behaviors node (this will be 
under system.serviceModel just like the client and services fragments):
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;behaviors&gt;
    &lt;endpointbehaviors&gt;
        &lt;behavior name="AuthenticationEPBehavior"&gt;
            &lt;enablewebscript /&gt;
        &lt;/behavior&gt;
    &lt;/endpointbehaviors&gt;
    &lt;servicebehaviors&gt;
    &lt;behavior name="AuthenticationServiceTypeBehaviors"&gt;
        &lt;servicemetadata httpgetenabled="true" /&gt;
        &lt;servicedebug includeexceptiondetailinfaults="true" /&gt;
    &lt;/behavior&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""&gt;
        &lt;servicemetadata httpgetenabled="true" /&gt;
        &lt;servicedebug includeexceptiondetailinfaults="false" /&gt;
    &lt;/behavior&gt;
    &lt;/servicebehaviors&gt;
    &lt;/behaviors&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Now, under Services, make sure that the endpoint node references the AuthenticationEPBehavior rule. For example, my Services fragment looks like this:
<p />
<pre>
    &lt;services&gt;
    &lt;service name="System.Web.ApplicationServices.AuthenticationService" behaviorconfiguration="AuthenticationServiceTypeBehaviors"&gt;
    &lt;endpoint contract="System.Web.ApplicationServices.AuthenticationService" binding="webHttpBinding" behaviorconfiguration="AuthenticationEPBehavior" 
              bindingnamespace="http://asp.net/ApplicationServices/v200" /&gt;
      &lt;/service&gt;
    &lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
<p />
Okay, now you should be good to go. All that is left is to add a couple of examples illustrating this stuff. I will give you two things: a simple AJAX call 
and the notation to determine if a user is currently logged in.
