    Over the past couple of months, I have been acquainting myself with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). SSRS is a great tool, and you can build reports really quickly
    using it. You can also illustrate your reports with charts, too, if you want to get fancy. The problem with SSRS, though, is that if you want just, say, a pie chart on
    your page, you have to jump through a considerable number of hoops. Basically, to limit your work, you have to be satisfied with the pie chart in another tab that is
    displaying a page generated by the SSRS web service.
<p />
    Okay, so I want some pie charts on my site, and I want to be able to do it quickly. I was thinking about all of the terrible things I could do to make JavaScript draw my
    pie chart for me when I remembered attending a workshop on AngularJS. The Angular app was working with something called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Then I thought to
    myself, "Hmmmm. I wonder how long it would take me to learn SVG just enough to build an AngularJS directive that will use SVG to present an array of pie charts on my
    page?" As it turns out, not long (less than a day). The directive part is sort of a directive. It is built as a directive, but I'm sure I've offended some AngularJS purists out there somewhere.
    I will show you anyway.
<p />
    The first thing you need to understand is that you are probably going to require a third-party JavaScript tool to help you with your SVG. I chose Raphael. No particular reason,
    really. I just googled it and it came up. If you want to have a look, simply Google Raphael.js. Here's what we'll do:
<p />
<ol>
    <li>Have a look at the contract that contains the description of the chart array</li>
    <li>Have a look at the JavaScript that builds the pie charts</li>
    <li>Have a look at how the Angular directive works</li>
</ol>
<p />
    Ready?
