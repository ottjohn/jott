As part of the one-person team in my company's IT department, I get asked to do a lot of interesting things (yawn) to 
help them streamline existing processes. For instance, one branch of their company owns almost 70 Cricket stores. Another 
owns several Pawn shops. All of these stores are spread out all over the nation. This means that most of these stores are 
going to have different state and local taxes. 
<p />
Unfortunately, the guy who built their existing system hard-coded this information into stored procedures and then had a 
crazy long conditional based on storeid that would determine which rates were applied to the products being sold. Not only 
is this a very bad idea, but we also found out that most of the taxation was wrong. The solution: build a control panel 
that manages the state and local tax rates and then tear out the hard-coded values in the stored procedures and replaces 
them with lookups based on storeid. The first stop here is to select a state. One you do this, you can define local tax 
rules:

Once the state is selected, you get the following:
<p />

<p />
When you get to this first screen, everything is locked down except for the droplist at the top. From this screen, you can 
see that there are two local rules defined for stores in these locations in Nebraska. If you want to select one of the 
jurisdictions and update its associated values, you can do this by clicking the Update button on the lower right part of the 
screen. This will enable all of the associated elements (besides the state and the state rate), the impacted items can 
be changed, and those changes can be saved by clicking the  Submit button.

If a new jurisdiction needs to be added, the user simply clicks the New button and the screen is modified in the following way:

<p />
As most of the time, the rules associated how taxes are applied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in a state will not change, those 
rules are prepopulated. Now the user can simply enter in the local rules and save them so they can be assigned to a store.
