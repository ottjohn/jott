Since I'm the only programmer in the company at which I am currently employed, I sometimes have to go with pre-built or
mostly-built solutions when implementing something. Of course, anyone who has used pre-built or mostly-built solutions 
knows that they are far from that. When it came time to choose a member management framework for my applications, I went 
with the Membership provider. Not only does it do a fine job for small businesses, it is multi-tenant, and easily 
extendable. I've found that the membership provider and forms authentication does a fine job for me.
<p />
My registration process is more like a flow than anything else. To keep garbage out of the backends that I create, all 
registrants must be approved and processed before giving them rights to any part of the systems I build. Therefore, when 
registering, all of my applications begin with a screen that looks something like this:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/Registration.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
This is a very simplified version of my registration process, as these are the only fields I feel I need for this site. 
The screen here is used to collect registration information required by the membership provider and three pieces of 
extended information that I need: first name, last name, and email address. Once the user has completed filling out the 
form fields, his or her part of the registration process is complete. Upon clicking the Submit button, I send the following 
email:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/RegEmail.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Every modification to a user's membership is accompanied by a confirmation email. That would include actions such as 
retrieving a password, changing a passoword, or changing an email. Now that the user is registered, I have to go in 
for the approval process. To do this, I have to login, then click the membership menu item at the top of the screen, 
and then select the Members item on the screen that comes up:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/NewMemberList.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
I've basically found that when I'm looking for some basic JavaScript tools that some are overbuilt and cost money and 
some simply are not satisfactory. I decided, therefore, to make my own. You can adjust all colors on this grid, you can 
elect to not include the pager, you don't have to have scrolling on, you can alias the column headings, exclude certain 
columns, and rearrange the columns by dragging and dropping them if you like:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/GridDragDrop.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
That's as much of a plug I'm going to give that tool in this venue. It was fun to build. Anyway, to move along in the 
approval process, I double click the user name I want to work with, and the following screen magically shows up:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/MemberConfig.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Here, we get to the member configuration screen. The panel on the left is a feature tree that I created, which is employed 
to give or deny users specific access to certainl parts of my site. The top right is a dropdown menu that contains the 
applications that the overall site can be split up into and managed. For now, there is only Membership. At some later date 
I may decide to build a different component that can be managed under the umbrella of this SPA. The checkbox below needs 
to be checked if the member is to have access to the site at all (it can as well be unchecked to suspend membership 
privileges). The groups is assocated with the feature tree, as you will see in a moment. Finally, there are no roles 
defined for my site. I'm not sure if I will have any, as I am not certainly they are necessary for such a small application. 
In my professional sites, roles may or may not show up here for the same reasons. Let's say, then, we want to approve 
Tom for the site, and we want to select a group for him to be a part of:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/Membership/MemberConfig2.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
As you can see, the feature tree has opened up and the features that Tom can be a part of are automatically selected. If 
I want to personalize Tom's permissions, I can check any number of feature boxes (or uncheck them), the only difference 
when saved being that the profile will not be assoicated with a predifined group. 
<p />
A short note about the feature tree: this is another little app that I built because I could not find anything really 
suitable online. Like the grid, it works with a JSON object and gets its values from a single, self-referencing table 
in SQL Server. The depth of the feature levels is indefinite, and the tool itself is built on the client using 
recursive JavaScript. As with the grid, it is as well loosely tucked into a custom directive or it can be used outsite 
of one as well.

Once I am done configuring the user, I click the Assign Profile and the user now has access to the site.
