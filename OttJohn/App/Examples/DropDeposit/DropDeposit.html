it's funny that in a world where it seems that everyone is trying to go with service-based consumption when dealing with 
third-party providers of mission-critical information, some businesses simply refuse to get on board with it and are 
fine with staying in the dark ages. Such is the reality of working for a company that owns Cricket stores. Don't get 
me wrong: it's not my company's fault. That rests squarely on the shoulders of Cricket (now AT&T), their own services, 
and their third-party providers. Messy is a nice word for it.
<p />
So anyway, the stores have to do these things called cash drops and deposits. They do the cash drops through the Cricket 
POS called RQ, but they do not provide a really decent way of managing those drops and deposits in-house, so we have to 
write software that will manage some of it on our end for reporting purposes. Now, you'd think that a big company like 
Cricket would have a service to grab the daily drops and even keep track of our deposits, right? Wrong! Long story short, 
we needed a screen that would capture these drops that were sent to us via Excel document and pushed into a SQL Server 
backend. What follows are some screen shots of the associated project.
<p />
The following screen is the first that the user sees when navigating to the part of the application that manages drops and 
deposits:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositEntry.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Behind the scenes, the user has already logged into the application. Upon entering this part of it, the UserId is used to 
grab all associated stores. These stores are placed into the dropdown at the top of the screen. Once as store is selected, 
all of the open drops (those drops that have not been deposited) are displayed in a checkbox list in the middle of the screen, 
like so:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositDrops.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Here the user can select drops from the list to make a deposit. Each row in the list has several behaviors:
<ul>
    <li>
        If the drop has not yet been selected, selecting the checkbox will highlight the row and present the details of 
        the drop below to the user for a count confirmation.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the drop has not yet been selected, selecting the row will check the checkbox, highlight the row, and present 
        the details of the drop below to the user for a count confirmation.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the drop has already been confirmed, then a flag in its associated JSON object is set to include it in the 
        deposit. If the user unchecks the checkbox, all the information for the drop remains, but this flag is set so 
        that the drop is no longer included in the deposit.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the drop has already been confirmed, the selecting the row associated with the drop does nothing but make that 
        drop active so that its confirmation information can be viewed or updated.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        If no confirmation information is entered, or if a drop's confirmation information is incomplete, and the user 
        selects a different drop, the previously-selected drop is unchecked and ignored.
    </li>
</ul>
Once a drop is selected, the user must confirm the drop by recounting it before it can be associated with a drop. Here is 
what the screen looks like:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositSelectDrop.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
If there is a variance between the recount on the drop and the drop amount reported to Cricket, a reason must be entered into 
the associated confirm field. Once this information is filled out, the user clicks the Confirm button to add the drop to the 
deposit:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositPostConfirm.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
As usual with disconnected service, all of the drops in the report receive from Cricket are a day old. If we want to include 
a drop from the current day in the deposit, we have to manually enter it. We can do this by clicking Show Manual Drop button 
at the bottom of the screen (see first figure above). This will display the following:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositManualDrop.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
As you can see, there are only two fields: one is the drop amount, the other is the transaction number that was given to the 
user by Cricket when the drop was entered in their system. The user can then include this drop in the deposit by clicking the 
Add Manual Drop button at the bottom of the screen:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositConfirmManual.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Once the user clicks that button, the drop is added to the top of the list, its associated checkbox is checked, and it is 
presented for confirmation. The confirmation is done in the same way an aged drop is confirmed. If there is a variance from 
the reported count, it must be explained. If there is not variance, there is no need to fill in the Reason field. Once this 
is done, the drop is included in the deposit by clicking Confirm button. Clicking this button adds the drops to a JSON 
object that contains a list of drops to be deposited. 
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DropDeposit/DropDepositMakeDeposit.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
Once all of the drops for the deposit have been selected, the user can click the Deposit button, which will associated the 
selected drops to a single deposit in our backend for reporting purposes.
