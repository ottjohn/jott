Disconntected entities (and here I mean those that have no service layer to access third-party data) must be really 
frustrating for some people. Being a programmer, I just do what I'm told and offer advice where I can (especially when 
it comes into trying to talk to third-party providers about exposing a public endpoint for use by customers). The poor 
guys at work have to deal with this every single day. Part of my job is to make their lives easier. Sometimes, however, 
it's hard to work on something like this when you do there's a much better solution.

Anyway, the company I work for owns four businesses, and the CFO needs end-of-day financials from his managers. I'm not 
even going to try to pretend where these guys get this information from, but when one of the businesses owns almost 70 
Cricket stores, the process has to be somewhat painful. It actualy makes me cringe to even think about it. Okay, so there 
are two parts to this piece: data collection and an ad hoc report. The data collection was simple to build and allows either 
one or multiple managers to fill in some or all of the fields:

<p />
There are four companies, so there are four collapsable sections of the data entry component. Therefore, if a manager wants 
to enter the end-of-day numbers for Cricket, he just clicks on the first section:
<p />

<p />
And if he wants to enter the end-of-day numbers for the next company, he simply clicks the next section:
<p />
<img src="App/Examples/DailySummary/SummaryDataEntry3.png" style="display: block;" />
<p />
The end-of-day numbers can be entered all at once or individually, it does not matter. Each day's summary has a parent table 
in the database that simply has a ParentId and a date. All of the other data is granularized into seven sub-tables that make 
the data easier to use when it comes time to create reports focused on just month-over-month profits or cost of doing 
business. The CFO wanted a report embedded with the app that combined all of the data from all of the businesses so he could 
have a snapshot of how things were going financially at the end of each day. This report, at first site, looks like this:
<p />

<p />
In each of these sections, however, there are drill-downs to support a more granular overview. So with the first-listed 
company, for instance, we have

<p />
And ...

The ad hoc report was fun to make.
