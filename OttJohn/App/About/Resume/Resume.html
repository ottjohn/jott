                This part is easy. I will not tuck my resume into this box. Rather, I will give you a link, and the resume, in all its glory, will show up in
                a pop-up. I have also provided a link to my LinkedIn account. If you want to know more about me and see more of how I think, look at my profile
                and take a look at some of my contributions in the groups I follow.
