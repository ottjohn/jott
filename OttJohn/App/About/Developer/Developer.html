                I didn't get into programming until after I got out of high school. Basically because back in those days home computers
                didn't exist, at least not in the form that we know them today. When some affordable and programmable computers did finally arrive
                on the marktet, I borrowed one from a friend and started messing around with it. I made my own pong game, but the tape drive made
                the whole experience unpalatable. Computers had emerged, but they were about as useful as a pet rock, so I returned the machine to 
                my friend and focused on other things.
                <p />
                A few months later, I started college, and I thought I'd give the programming thing another shot by enrolling in a Fortran class.
                I thought it might be fun. Boy was I wrong. Fortan by itself did not look very difficult, but a class full of 100 students, all of 
                whom had to share two key-punch machines, did not please my palate one Iota, especially when you take into consideration that the class 
                was at eight in the morning. After about two days of waiting hours just to sit in front of a machine that had probably been invented 
                by Fred Flinstone, a dropped it and tried to focus on mathematics and mroe manageable electives. Unfortunately for me, the Sierra's had 
                quite a haul of snow that year, and I wound up focusing on skiing instead. 
                <p />
                Then came the Air Force, which was quite fun. My first assignment was to pretend I was a military pay clerk at a small air base in 
                Bitburg, Germany. Part of my job description was data entry. The first computer I was placed in front of was a key-punch machine. 
                Unlike the aforementioned Fortran class, I couldn't just walk out of the Air Force. I guess it was in the stars that Fred Flinstone 
                and I had to have one more dance. Fortunately, that dance didn't last long. One day, while I was lamenting having to stack and catalogue 
                cards, a delivery came. It was a Zenith personal computer. Something nobody knew how to use, but the directive from the brass was to leverage 
                it to streamline our processes. And the machine was a beauty! It had two 5.25 inch floppy drives, a little monochromatic screen, 640 KB of 
                RAM, an 8088 chip that zipped along at 4.7 Mhz, and a bulky keyboard. I turned it on and immediately made a connection.
                Two years later I was no longer a travel pay clerk for the Air Force: with encouragement and permission from the Accounting and
                Finance Officer, I was sitting with different people in the office, learning their jobs, and automating them. I loved it.
                <p />
                However much I loved computer programming, I never pursued it academically. After I separated from the Air Force, I went back to 
                school full time and persued a dual major in Mathematics and English Literature. I kept programming as a hobby, though, which helped to pay 
                my way through school. After I received my diploma, I thought about an advanced degree in English for about two seconds and decided on a 
                Master's in Mathematics. Practicality won out. The English degree certainly would have been more fun. Once I was done with that, 
                I accepted a job at a small comminity college in central Iowa teaching mathematics. I figured my programming days were behing me. Nothing 
                could have been further from the truth.
                <p />
                Shortly after I arrived in Iowa, the VP of Academic Affairs snagged me to help him build an E-Commerce curriculum. He sent me all
                over the place to learn, and I loved it. After about two years of that, we had a decent curriculum (a little too flat for my tastes), and 
                I was actually teaching a number of the courses. I had met and kept in touch with several people I had met at the conferences I was sent to, 
                and one of them kept bugging me about moving to Oregen to work with him in this really great startup. "We'll be rich!," He said. And 
                I believed him. Two months after our initial converstaion, I was in Portland.
                <p />
                I was green. I had skills, especially on the client, but I. Was. Green. I had, and still do have, a great work ethic, however, and
                in a short time, I was building DHTML-enabled classic ASP pages and working with stored procedures in Sql Server 2000. My skillset
                was basically the same as everyone else's at the time, and, fortunately, I got my legs, so to speak, before the startup went under. I
                jumped directly into a Senior Developer position at McAfee.com, where I did pretty much the same thing as I had done at the startup.
                Here, I was also able to build up some significant XML skills, which I used to describe complex systems on the client
                and then convert those to DHTML with xPath.
                <p />
                I kept doing this for a about a year, and then got called back into teaching (which you can read about in the Educator section here).
                I love to teach, and I also love to program. Programming pays better, though, so I hopped back into programming after about three
                years, finding myself at yet another startup. Again, it only lasted a year. By this time, though, I had added asmx-based
                web services and C# to my tooklkit, and I had become very proficent at making single page apps. In fact, I had been creating single page apps
                using this system for quite some time.
                <p />
                Of course, as startups do, this one failed too. I found myself then working for Corporate Express. Interesting time. I was converting
                Classis ASP pages to the more "advanced" ASP.NET postback web apps. While I could write up ASP.NET applications as well as anyone else,
                they gave me the dry heaves. I did not like the technology one bit. You see, using JavaScript, you can highlight an item on a custom grid 
                object on the client; doing the same thing with ASP.NET, on the other hand, requires a trip to Virginia first. Dry heaves. I was, however, 
                able to flesh out some of my c# skills all the while inventing ways to use JavaScript to hijack intrinsic ASP.NET functionality.
                <p />
                The Market crashed and I got laid off. Thankfully, I was picked up almost immediately by a company that specializes in putting together
                packages for cable, phone, and internet. I was told I would have a web developer spot there, but I was shuffled into a position that mostly
                required the use of c#. As positions go, it wasn't the best spot I'd ever been in, but it paid the bills. My main concern was that I could 
                not spread myself around so easily. You know, work on different parts of the stack. I really like to work on everything. I also did not like 
                how some of the lead developers would sometimes see shiny things called design pattern floating by them and make a point of stuffing their 
                new-found knowledge into production without telling anyone. Developers, please take note: just because you read about something and it seems to be interesting does not
                mean that it is practical for what you're doing at work. A few design patterns are fine. They help. Having heap-fulls of them floating about in your
                code is counter-productive and irritating.
                <p />
                I lasted at this place a little more than three years before I was part of a mass layoff. Honestly, I have to tell you that a part of me 
                was happy to be done with the place. It was too big. Too corporate. Too political. And too caught up in process. When I left, I figured I had 
                wasted my time. Regressed. I could not have been more wrong. Once I was out of that place, the enormity of what I had learned there hit me in the face like 
                a brick: it had given me the gift of decent architecture. Now, occassionaly, I get a little misty-eyed when I think back on that place. Well, not really. 
                You couldn't drag me back there even if you hitched me to a dozen horses! Anyway, once I escaped from the corporate phase of my life 
                I landed a job with a very small company building a variety of products, and that's where I am as of this writing.
                <p />
                Over the years, I have embraced and let go of quite a number of skills. Today, I mostly work with the following: SQL Server 2008, TSql,
                stored procedures, SSMS, SSRS (basic), c#, LinqToSql, MV*, JavaScript, Angular, XML, IIS, WCF, REST, Web API, SPA, HTML, SVG (basic), and security.
                I use these skills to create single page applications. I worked hard to build up my skillset, and I like working for places that will
                allow and encourage me to use every one of them: that means I like to work on all layers pretty much all the time. Let me do that, and
                I think we'll both be happy.
