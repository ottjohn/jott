                While I love to code (when I'm allowed to work full-stack), in my mind that undertaking pales to teaching. There is an obvious reason for
                this (at least to me). You see, when I code, I rarely impact anyone but myself. There is a lot of reward that comes from it, and it really
                is good for the pocketbook, but a really important aspect regarding life is absent: what am I doing to help other people?
                <p />
                When I was going to college, I would help pay for my tuition by taking on odd programming jobs. The bulk of my truition, however,
                was paid for by teaching assistanceships at the university and part-time positions at the local community college. As a teacher, I am
                a lot like I am as a developer: I would not last very long if I were only teaching three or four courses within the same curriculum;
                therefore, while I taught math at the university, I used my English degree to allow me to teach English at the community college. Peanut
                butter and jelly. That's how they went together for me.
                <p />
                While I do admit that I have butterflies at the beginning of every semester, I immensely enjoy the interaction I have with all of my classes.
                Whether I taught English or math, it made me feel good when a student went out of his or her way to appraoch me at the end of a class or
                semester to tell me that my presentation was the best he or she had ever had in the subject. I'm not going to say that all of my students liked
                me. Far from it. When you are assigned classes in which students are placed, some of them resent it, and they can and will go out of their way
                to let you know that. Most of the time, I took that as a challege to see if I could make those students start to like the subjects I
                taught. In many cases, I succeeded; in many cases, I failed. I did, however, try to make my classes as entertaining as possible.
                With no exceptions, my classes were always full of the Socratic method, group work, board work, funny word problems, and steadfast attempts to make engagement
                with the class more like a conversation than a lecture. In none of my classes would you ever find Power Point or a lecture straight from
                the book.
                <p />
                I know at this point you're probably asking the following question to yourself, "Okay, so here's a developer who teaches math and English. Why 
                is he not teaching comptuer-related courses?" Well, I did, but I had to do it on my own terms. While I was employed full time as a developer and 
                becoming more and more proficient at my craft, I would occassionally look at courses of study related to computer science and wondered to myself if 
                the curriculums were more exercies in futility than utility (I know that aforementioned statement is going to piss some people off, and I do apologize 
                for that, but that doesn't dismiss the veracity of my musing when applied to those students who wanted to secure a programming position right after 
                college). 
                <p />
                My searches through college curriculum associated with computer programming disciplines isn't something I just did out of the blue to kill time. I had 
                experience with helping to build such programs myself. About a year into my first full-time teaching job in Iowa, the VP for Academic
                Affairs approched me about helping out with an E-Commerce curricum. I jumped at the opportunity. I worked especially hard to prepare for all of the meetings,
                learned some languages, and was rewarded by trips all over the country to learn and network. By the time a year was out, I had a decent-looking
                curriculum in hand. It was, however, still lacking. We taught it anyway.
                <p />
                Teaching computer programming courses was fun, but it didn't last terribly long for me. After about a year of it, a friend I met at a conference in 
                California talked me into joining a startup he was a part of and I found myself in Portland, Oregon. While I immsersed myself in new technolgies and
                tried to get used to the idea of not having most of my summers off (I talk to my boss about that, but he wouldn't budge), the idea of a proper web 
                programming curriculum never left my mind. I kept on working on it, and, finally, a couple of years later, I had one: a full two-year curriculum 
                based on the microsoft stack: essentially, the coursework covered an ASP.NET client swappable with DHTML using XMLHttp, ASMX, c#, and SQL Server. 
                I wrote up an abstract outlining the program, and shopped it. I got bites immediately, and I knew my most recent three-year stint in programming full 
                time was nearing its end.
                <p />
                The interviews, at times, were not that fun. I had worked for a few years gaining practical skills and transplanting those skills into my curriculum
                to wash away the stunning inadequacies of the typical community college programming curriculum. My most basic gripe with most of the colleges who
                advertised web programming coursework was the agonizing flatness of them: HTML, Dreamweaver, Design, JavaScript, Perl, C#, Java, etc. If you don't
                already know, community colleges exist not only to educate their students but to service the community around them. When they build curriculums like
                this, they sometimes have to have an advisory board, and then the inevitable happens: you stuff the curriculum so full of competing technologies
                that you are doing no one any favors. Some of these schools even offered courses in Xml. Really? What for?
                <p />
                After shopping my curriculum to six different schools, I got three offers, the best of which was from a small college in Sioux City, Iowa. Amazing, huh?
                For some of the schools, they had trouble dealing with a well-defined first year and very vague second year in which there was some coursework but mostly
                projects. At Sioux City, I got the program off the ground. Within a year, I had some decent mini-developers. After the second year, I helped some of those newly-
                minted developers start a business, helped them get clients (some of them offering fairly large projects), helped them get an office downtown, and
                helped them get on the front page of the local newspaper. All things being equal, it was Sioux City; so after a time, the really sweet projects
                dried up, and many of the developers moved on.
                <p />
                How have they moved on, you ask? I have former students working all over the Midwest. Some of them are making really good money, just as much as any
                other developer. Some are managers. One is a director. And it all started from a two-year curriculum in web applications programming! This is what
                I mean by impact. I have not heard from a lot of those students. Some of us keep in contact and even meet occassionally. But even if they don't
                remember me or don't even like me, they are where they are today partly because of me. And that, my friends, is a whole lot of impact! That, to me, is the best
                accomplishment anyone can have.
