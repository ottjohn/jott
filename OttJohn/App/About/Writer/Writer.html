                Warning: if you have any problems at all with questionable language or the use of expletives, this is your chance to leave this little part of my 
                domain. Most of what follows describes a manuscript I wrote, which is the result of an issue I have of a certain subset of what we call humans. 
                You have been warned.
                <p />
                I have always loved to write. That's why I pursued a degree in English Literature. While I liked math, the challenge of it, the curriculum 
                offered up by English Lit was pure joy. Many times I would find myself reclined on a sofa reading or outside watching some Shakespeare production  
                and wonder how the hell I could be earning credit for something that was so damn fun! If I had followed my heart, I would have earned my Phd in English 
                Literature, and I would right now be teaching Shakespeare and the Metatphysical poets. To dream, huh? Practicality, however, got in the way.
                <p />
                But that didn't stop me from following my passion, at least in one big manifestation that is now an unpublished manuscript. A lot of people want to write 
                a novel. So many of us think we have it in us. But before you can actually begin one, before you start that years' long journey, you need to have some 
                kind of reason to do so. So it was for me. I found mine. And it turned out it was very easy for me to write about. Do ever get moved by the news? To tears? 
                Do you ever read a novel and become so immersed in it that you want to live the life of the protagonist and do what he does and 
                live what he lives? 
                <p />
                I am especially moved by evil. Evil perpetrated against young victims. Years ago I read a story about a very young girl who was abducted by a neighber, 
                raped, and left to die in the scortching hot sun of the California desert. Left to die, reader. A real life. She succumbed after brutalization to dhydration 
                and scortching by the sun in a lonely desert. I have to tell you that this made me cry. A lot. I was so beside myself that if I had the opportunity to 
                put a bullet in the head of the offender, I would have gladly done so, without equivocation and without remorse. It would have been like removing some 
                bloated tick from the arm of humanity, squishing it, taking the life from it, so it could never offend again. It would have simply been doing a favor for 
                the world, eliminating from the gene pool that which should not have been a part of it to begin with. That is how I felt. That is how I still feel.
                <p />
                Without remorse. Without Remorse. The name of my favorite book by Tom Clancy. A guy named Mr. Clark is the protagonist. He's a real badass. So, instead of hunting 
                down and killing the sub-human scum mentioned in the paragraph above, I took to my computer and allowed Clark to do it. It was a peice of about six pages, and 
                I have to tell you it purged some demons killing that fucker in the most agonizing way I could come up with. It felt good. When I was finished, I sent the text 
                to a few friends of mine, and some of them asked me if Clancy was coming out with a new novel. Nope. Just me purging. A catharsis of sorts that, unfortunaly, can 
                only last until the next young person winds up in the news and is found in a dump.
                <p />
                And that's exactly what happened. A little girl was found in a dump. After having been violated in the most monstrous way. You can't imagine how she felt. A 
                little, innocent six year old girl, being brutally raped and murdered by some scum who does not deserve to breath the same air as you and I. A sub-human animal 
                who's only goal in life is to brutalize. A phychopath who deserves nothing more than to be erased, to have his entire existence denied. 
                <p />
                So I wrote. I put myself in the position of the parent. What would I do? I was honest in the writing, and I planned everything my protagonist did the same way 
                I would do it. Would I wait for justice? Hell no! Being a single parent, I would exert every single ounce of energy, every single dime I had, to track down 
                the son of a bitch and end his life in such a violent and depraved way that his expulsion from life would be welcomed, begged-for. So I wrote. And wrote. And 
                wrote.
                <p />
                Along the way, I learned some things. One, yes, writing is difficult. When you first start out. Two, when you get into it a little bit, say a hundred pages, 
                you no longer own the story. Your characters do. After about 100 pages, the characters were literally telling me what to write. So I listened. About 430 pages later, 
                I was done. At least with the first draft. I took my work to a conference, pitched it to five agents, and got smiles from four. All four, however, said it was 
                about 100 pages too long. I have since been trying to shorten it, but between work and some bad experiences with life, I have not accomplished much. But having 
                done it, having written a manuscript, just might be enough. I may reduce it. Who knows? But the writing itself was an accomplishment and a good exercise in 
                discovering who I am.
                <p />
                I have the manuscript here. It is tucked in with my articles under the category Fiction. If you would like to read it, be my guest. I would appreciate the feedback. 
                If it moves you, I am glad. It was a work of passion for me.
